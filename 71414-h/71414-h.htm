<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>In</span> the spring of 1885, when planning to attend the British
Association meeting in Aberdeen that summer, it struck me
that I might prepare a paper on a Woman’s Subject, and try
to find an opportunity of reading it before the Section of
Economics and Statistics there. The paper divided itself
into two, which I carefully entitled—I. The History and
Statistics of Woman’s Privilege; and II. The Economic
Effects of the Abstention of Women from Voting.</p>
<p class='c008'>They were, as might have been expected, both rejected.
I was told that, though they formed valuable contributions to
Constitutional History, the Committee felt they would certainly
lead to political discussion, which must not be risked.
At a public meeting in Aberdeen the same week, I gave a
resumé of my arguments, and the materials then collected I
have frequently used since in Drawing-room Addresses, and
in private conversation; in public papers, and in friendly correspondence.
So many have been surprised at the facts, and
interested in the results, that, at the present crisis, I thought
it advisable to spend another six months in careful verification
of details, and in grouping apparently disconnected data,
so that their full import might be seen at a glance. My first
authorities were Sydney Smith’s “Enfranchisement of
Woman the Law of the Land” (1876), and Mr. Chisholm
Anstey’s Book and Papers on “The Representation of the
People’s Acts” (1876).</p>

<p class='c008'>Thence I went through the materials of Constitutional
History, the Statutes, Rolls of Parliament, State Papers,
Parliamentary Writs, Journals of the House of Commons,
Reports of Cases, Works on Law, History, and Archæology,
both printed and manuscript.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as my paper was complete enough for the purpose
in hand, M. Ostrogorski’s book upon “Women’s Rights”
appeared. But he had considered the question in regard to
all women, I, only in regard to British Freewomen. He
was the more general, I the more special, and I had noted
several points which had escaped him in regard to the prime
question of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>I consulted Miss Helen Blackburn, Editor of the <i>Englishwoman’s
Review</i>, and she urged me to bring out what I had
prepared. She had always thought the work necessary, had
intended to undertake it herself, when she could find leisure,
and thought that now was the most fitting time to publish.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>She generously placed her notebooks at my disposal,
whence I have gleaned many interesting facts in support of
my own. Therefore this little book may be taken as her
voice as well as mine. The points I specially wish to be
considered, are:—</p>

<p class='c008'>1st, The Ethnological.—The racial characteristics of our
ancestors. They reverenced women.</p>

<p class='c008'>2nd, The Philological.—All old Statutes are couched in
<i>general</i> terms. Through a deficiency in the English
language, the word “man” is a common term, including
woman as well as man, even by Statute.</p>

<p class='c008'>3rd, The Legal.—The Late Laureate speaks of the liberties
of men as widening down from precedent to precedent.
We find that the liberties of women have, on the other
hand, been narrowed down from precedent to precedent.
Sir Edward Coke, the technical cause of this limitation, is
only a fellow mortal, liable to error.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th, The Historical, in which facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th, The Biblical, in which prejudice and mistranslation
have confused the ideas of readers on this point. Some may
disagree with my conclusions, but I trust they may accept
the facts, and do what they can with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one can deny that it is <i>just</i> to grant women the
Suffrage, no one can deny that it would be <i>advantageous for
them</i> to receive it. There is no reason that a thing should
be because it has been, but when the only objection brought
against a thing is, that it has not been, it is time to test if
that statement be really true. We have not found the
received assertions true in regard to this subject. Hence
the publication of this little book.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus far I had written as Preface to the little Brochure
that I printed for the use of the Women’s Suffrage Societies
a month ago. But as the whole Thousand was ordered
before it came from the printers, it was evident that I ought
to publish my work formally, with the many additions I had
held back from lack of space, and with the article from the
<i>Athenæum</i>, No. 3475, which I had been permitted to incorporate.
Amongst the Labour-saving appliances of the day,
may be classified collections of verified facts. I trust these
may reach the hands of those for whom I write, <i>brave women</i>
and <i>fair men</i>.</p>

    <div>ANCIENT HISTORY AND BRITISH WOMEN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Let us look at the beginnings of things, for they help us to
understand the ends.”</p>
<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Though</span> early British traditions may survive in later
Literature, we cannot accept them for critical purposes.
The century of the birth of Christ is the earliest date of
our authentic history. The words of the Romans,
strangers and enemies, are unexceptionable witnesses.
Nothing impressed the Romans more than the equality
of the sexes among the Northern nations; the man’s
reverence for womanhood, the woman’s sympathy with
manhood, and the high code of morality that was the
natural outcome of this well-balanced society.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Plutarch (“de Virtut Mul.”) says, “Concerning the virtues
of women, I am not of the same mind with Thucydides.
For he would prove that she is the best woman concerning
whom there is least discourse made by people
abroad, either to her praise or dispraise; judging that as
the person, so the very name of a good woman ought to
be retired and not to gad abroad.... And seeing that
many worthy things, both public and private, have been
done by women, it is not amiss to give a brief historical
account of those that are public in the first place.”
Among the examples he cites, there is that of the continental
Celts, kindred to the British. Some of these
wandered north-west, and some due south. “There
arose a very grievous and irreconcilable contention
among the Celts before they passed over the Alps to
inhabit that tract of Italy which now they inhabit, which
proceeded to a civil war. The women, placing themselves
between the armies, took up the controversies,
argued them so accurately, and determined them so impartially
that an admirable friendly correspondence and
general amity ensued, both civil and domestic. Hence
the Celts made it their practice to take women into consultation
about peace or war, and to use them as mediates
in any controversies that arose between them and
their allies. In the league, therefore, made with Hannibal,
the writing runs thus—If the Celts take occasion of
quarrelling with the Carthaginians, the governors and
generals of the Carthaginians in Spain shall decide the
dispute; but if the Carthaginians accuse the Celts, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Celtic women shall decide the controversy.” The Romans
were much struck by the similar position of women
among the Britons, Belgic and Celtic alike. Elton, on
the authority of Ammianus Marcellinus, says of the
women, “that their approximation to the men in stature
was the best evidence that the nation had advanced out
of barbarism.” Cæsar tells us (“Eng.” 117) that the
British women were made use of in Court, in Council,
and in Camp, and that no distinction of sex was made in
places of command or government. Selden, in his
chapter on “Women” in the “Janus Anglorum,” reminds
us, that “Boadicea so successfully commanded
the British armies as to beat and conquer the Roman
Viceroy, and no doubt that noble lady was a deliberative
member of the Council where the resolution was taken
to fight, and that she should command the forces.”
Tacitus (“Vita Agric.,” c. xv.) says, “Under the leadership
of Boadicea, a woman of kingly descent (for they
admit of no distinction of sex in their royal successions),
they all rose to arms. Had not Paulinus, on hearing of
this outbreak, rendered prompt succour, Britain would
have been lost.” He owns elsewhere that had the
Britons but been able to unite among themselves, the
Romans could not have conquered them; and he more
than once notes the bravery of the women in stimulating
the warriors.</p>

<p class='c008'>More fully in his “Annals” (B. xiv.), Tacitus describes
how Suetonius Paulinus attacked Mona (Anglesea) the
stronghold of the Druids; and how the women priestesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>dashed about clothed in black, like furies, with dishevelled
hair, and with torches in their hands, encouraging
and threatening the soldiers, and when all was lost,
perishing bravely among the flames kindled by the conqueror.
This is told, not in the tones with which one
belauds compatriot heroines, but in those of an enemy,
to whom these women added new terrors and increased
troubles. Meanwhile, in the East, the Roman statue of
Victory had fallen from its place in the temple of
Claudius at Camalodunum; evil signs and omens weakened
the hearts of the Roman soldiers, and frantic
Priestesses encouraged the hopes of the British force
thereby. Boadicea, having succeeded in uniting some
of the neighbouring tribes, had driven Catus over the
sea, had subdued Petelius Cerialus, had destroyed the
Colonia at Camalodunum, had sacked Verulam, and
marched on London, building an intrenched camp near
what we now call Islington. Suetonius Paulinus, fresh
from the slaughter of the sacred Druid host, advanced to
meet her. Tacitus describes the position of the armies,
and reports her speech. Not being “unaccustomed to
address the public,” she called her army to witness “that
it was usual for the Britons to war under the conduct of
women, but on that occasion she entered the field, not
as one descended from ancestors so illustrious to recover
her kingdom and her treasure, but as one of the humblest
among them, to take vengeance for liberty extinguished,
her own body lacerated with stripes, and the chastity of
her daughters defiled.... They would see that in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>battle they must conquer or perish. Such was the fixed
resolve of a woman; the men might live if they pleased and
be the slaves of the Romans.” “Neither was Suetonius
silent at so perilous a juncture, for though he confided
in the bravery of his men, yet he mingled exhortations
with entreaties. ‘In that great host were to be seen
more women than efficient men. Unwarlike, unarmed,
they would give way the instant they felt the sword and
valour of those victorious troops, etc.’” Then follows the
account of the battle. “The soldiers spared not even
the lives of the women, nay the very beasts, pierced
with darts, seemed to swell the heaps of the slain. The
glory gained that day was signal indeed, and equal to the
victories of ancient times, for there are authors who record
that of the Britons were slain almost 80,000, of our
men about 400, with not many more wounded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That Boadicea’s defeat was gloried in as being such a
triumph to the Roman arms is in itself a witness to her
prowess. The numbers of the slain did not likely represent
warriors alone. The carriages with their wives
and children lined the field. The Romans thought that
the defeated Britons <i>could not</i> fly past these. They
<i>would not</i>. Husbands, wives, and babes were slain together,
and reckoned together, perhaps the very beasts of
burden among the heaps of the slain were reckoned too.
Anything to increase the Roman “glory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no picture more touching in the history of
our country! The forces of oppression and lust, the
spirit of Nero himself, then Emperor, were ranged against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>this woman. With superhuman energy, as patriot, as
mother, and as <i>individual</i>, she struggled against these in
defence of country, home, and honour. And <i>she failed</i>!
Had circumstances been but slightly altered, had the
brave Caractacus been but able to hold out a little longer,
and take shelter with her, instead of trusting the rival
Queen Cartismandua, how differently might our British
history have read to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cartismandua was a Queen, too, in her own right,
wedded freely to the neighbouring Prince Venutius, but
nevertheless personally elected as the supreme ruler and
leader of the united tribes of the Brigantes, making contracts
and treaties for all. Caractacus, after his nine
years’ struggle, had fled for shelter and for help to her in
the year 50 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> But as Elton says in his “Origin of
English History,” “she was farseeing enough to see the
hopelessness of contest with the Romans.” Already
Romanised in heart and spirit, she betrayed her countryman,
cast off her husband, forfeited her honour, and
finally lost the crown of her inheritance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blameless Boadicea suffered for her sins twelve
years later, in that sad year of 62 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> That defeat rang
the death-knell of the freedom of British womanhood, and
of the spirit of British manhood. In such a crisis it is
<i>not</i> the fittest who survive. They who lived to tread
upon her grave were born of lower possibilities. Yet
she <i>has lived</i>, the typal woman of the British past.</p>

<p class='c008'>I know that I may be expected to speak of the Empress
Helena, claimed by Camalodunum (now Colchester) as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the only daughter of its Coel II., the wife of Constantius,
the mother of Constantine, the Christian convert, the
finder of the true cross. Good as she was, refined and
cultivated too, she was, nevertheless, but a Romanised
Briton, a Roman wife, a Roman mother, under Roman
Law. And the Roman Law was a meaner foster-mother
for feminine virtues than the free old British Law.</p>

<p class='c008'>The withdrawal of the Roman troops for home affairs
hastened a new crisis, in which the Britons, made limp by
protection and an alien government, were unable to hold
their own against invading tribes. No longer was the
British wife the brave help-meet, the counsellor, the
inspirer of the British man. Roman customs had completed
what the Roman arms and the Roman laws had
begun, and the spirit of British Womanhood had no reserve
force in itself to spare. Then came an infusion of
new blood into the land, fortunately not of Latin Race,
but of a good northern stock, that reverenced woman
still. Speaking of that stock in earlier times, Tacitus
(“Germ.” c. viii.) says, “The women are the most revered
witnesses of each man’s conduct, and his most liberal
applauders. To their mothers and their wives they
bring their wounds for relief, who do not dread to count
or search out the gashes. The women also administer
food and encouragement to those who are fighting.”
“They even suppose somewhat of sanctity and prescience
to be inherent in the female sex, and, therefore, neither
despise their counsels nor disregard their responses. We
have beheld, in the reign of Vespasian, Veleda, long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>reverenced by many as a deity. Aurima, moreover, and
several others, were formerly held in similar veneration,
but not with a similar flattery, nor as though they had
been goddesses (c. xviii). Almost alone among barbarians
they are content with one wife.... The wife
does not bring a dower to the husband, but the husband
to the wife.... Lest the woman should think herself to
stand apart from aspirations after noble deeds, and from
the perils of war, she is reminded by the ceremony which
inaugurates marriage (in which she is handed a spear)
that she is her husband’s partner in toil and danger,
destined to suffer and to dare with him alike in peace
and in war....” “She must live and die with the feeling
that she is receiving what she must hand down to her
children, neither tarnished, nor depreciated, what future
daughters-in-law may receive, and may so pass on to her
grandchildren” (c. xix). “Thus with their virtue protected,
they live uncorrupted by the allurements of public
shows or the stimulant of feastings. Clandestine correspondence
is equally unknown to men and women.
The young men marry late, and their vigour is unimpaired.
Nor are the maidens hurried into marriage.
Well-matched and vigorous they wed, and the offspring
reproduce the strength of their parents” (Church’s
Translation).</p>

<p class='c008'>These racial peculiarities also marked the early Saxon
invaders, though there were no foreign witnesses to note
them with surprise. The native writers took them too
much as a matter of course to consider them worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>noting. It is only indirectly that we can glean the state
of affairs from public records. Samuel Heywood, in his
“Ranks of the People among the Anglo-Saxons,” says
(p. 2), “The word Cwen<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a> originally signified a wife in
general, but was by custom converted into a title for the
wife of a king.... It was customary for Saxon
monarchs to hold their courts with great solemnity three
times a year. The Queen Consort, at these assemblies,
wore her crown also, and was seated on a throne near
the King. When an assembly of the nobles met at
Winchester to adjust the complaints of the secular
clergy against St. Dunstan, the King presided, having his
Queen seated by his side (“Eadmer de Vita St. Dunstan,”
2 Aug. Sacra., 219)....”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Cwen” originally meant a wife, but it also meant a <i>companion</i>
or <i>peer</i>, hence in old French Histories we see it used instead of
Count, as “Thibaut Cwens de Champagne.” In a roll in the Tower
of London, Simon de Montfort is called “Quens of Leycester”
(Selden’s “Titles of Honour”).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“The Queen Consort had her separate household and
attendants....” “It is highly probable that in ancient
as well as modern times the Queen Consort was considered
as <i>feme sole</i> in all legal proceedings. Sir Edward
Coke being called on to prove that this was the common
law before the Conquest, produced a charter made by
Ethelswurth, Queen of the Mercians, in the lifetime of
her husband, giving away the lands in her own power,
her husband being only an attesting witness. We find
Queens Consort acting in all other respects as <i>femes
soles</i> in tenure, management, and alienation of real property.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Emma, Ethelred’s Queen, gave a munificent grant
to St. Swithins, Winchester. Alswythe, the Queen of
King Alfred, began to erect a house for nuns at Winchester,
finished by her son Edward. Queens attested
their husband’s grants, and recorded their assents to acts
done and engagements made. Queens Dowager were
also present, and subscribed their names to Royal grants
as being content with them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Though, of course, the Royal rank increased the
woman’s power, the law and custom for Queens was but
the reflex of the common law and custom of the time
for all women. Selden says, “Ladies of birth and
quality sat in the Saxon Witenagemot,” and Gurdon, in
his “Antiquities of Parliament,” vol. i., p. 164, adds,
“Wightred, the next Saxon legislator, summoned his
Witas to the Witenagemot at Berghamstead, where his
laws were made with the advice and consent of his
Witas (which is a <i>general</i> term for the nobility), for the
laws were signed by the King, Werburg his Queen, the
Bishops, Abbots, Abbesses, and the <i>rest</i> of the Witas” (<i>see</i>
“Sax. Chron.,” 48). In Spelman’s “Concilia Britannica,”
p. 190, we find also that Wightred’s council at Beconceld
(694) included women, for the Queen and Abbesses
signed the decisions along with the King and the Abbots
(p. 192). The charter to Eabba the Abbess is granted by
Wightred and his Queen (p. 486).</p>

<p class='c008'>The charter to Glastonbury is signed, after the name
of the King, “Ego Eilfgiva ejusdem Regis Mater cum
gaudio consensi” (p. 533). In the “Diploma Comiti,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Regis Angliæ,” after the King’s name, “Ego Emma
Regina signo crucis confirmo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The second charter of Edward the Confessor to St.
Peter’s at Westminster contains not only the signature of
the sainted King, but “Ego Editha Regina huic donationi
Regiæ consentiens subscripsi” (p. 631). And at the
council summoned to consider the Bull of Nicholas the
Pope to Edward the Confessor, after the King, signs
“Ego Edgida Regina omni alacritate mentis hoc corroboravi.”
The different expressions used, show that the
signatures were no mere accident, no vapid formality.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the council held to grant privileges to the Church
“præsentibus etiam clarissimis Abbattissis, hoc est,
Hermehilda, Truinberga and Ataba reverenda, ut subscriberent
rogavi” (p. 198).</p>

<p class='c008'>“King Edgar’s charter to the Abbey of Crowland
(961) was signed with the consent of the nobles and
abbesses, for many Abbesses were formerly summoned to
Parliament” (Plowden’s “Jura Anglorum,” p. 384.
Also William Camden’s “Antiquity of Parliament”).</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ego Ælfrith Regina” signs the Charter that the
King of Mercia grants to the Abbey of Worcester.
“Ethelswith Regina” subscribes with Burghred, King of
Mercia or Mercland, in the Register of Worcester.</p>

<p class='c008'>Edward the Confessor’s charter to Agelwin is confirmed
by his wife, “Ego Edgith Regina consentio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So in a charter of King Knut to St. Edmundesbury,
his wife, Alfgwa, signs, “Ego Alfgifa Regina” (Selden’s
“Titles of Honour”).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>There had been amid the Saxons, Queens Regnant as
well as Queens Consort. William of Malmesbury writes
in admiration of Sexburga, the Queen Dowager of Cenwalch,
King of the West Saxons, 672, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, “that there
was not wanting to this woman a great spirit to discharge
the duties of the kingdom. She levied new armies, kept
the old ones to duty, governed her subjects with clemency,
kept her enemies quiet with threats, in a word, did everything
at that rate that there was no other difference
between her and any King in management except her
sex” (“Malmesb. Gest. Reg.,” b. i.). Ethelfleda, too, the
daughter of the great Alfred, called the Lady of Mercia,
ruled that kingdom after the death of her father and her
husband for eight years, and completed the work that
her great father had begun in finally defeating and subjugating
the intruding Danes. Women landowners sat
in the Shire Gemote, or held Motes of their own; women
Burgesses were present at Folkmotes, or at Revemotes.
In short, the privileges of women in the Saxon times were
nearly equal to those they held in British times.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Abbess Hilda presided over the monastery at Streneshalh,
Whitby, where was a man’s wing, and a woman’s wing,
the church coming between them. Among her disciples
were educated many learned bishops. An ecclesiastical
synod met at her abbey (664), at which she presided, that
the calm of her presence and the influence of her control
might soothe excitement on the vexed questions of the
day, chiefly those regarding Easter. There were delegates
from Rome, from the Scots, from the Angles, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Britons (<i>see</i> lib. 3, c. xxv., and lib. 4, c. xxiii., xxiv.).
Also Spelman’s “Concilia” (p. 145) describes “Synodis
Pharensis rogatu Hildæ illic Abbatissæ celebratæ.” The
earliest British writer still extant, Gildas of Alcluid (now
Dumbarton), reports this fact without comment or surprise.
Spelman preserves also (p. 205) “Epistola
Johannis Pa. VII.,” to “Ethelredum Regem Merciorum.”
“Episcopus suo more obnitentibus beatissima virgo
Elfleda soror Alfridi, Abbattissa post Hildam de Streneshalh,
terminum negotio fixit dicens Dimissus ambagibus
testamentum fratris mei, cui præsens interfui, profero,”
etc. Other women held similar positions in England,
as well as St. Bridget of the Abbey of Kildare in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Norman invaders swept like a whirlwind over
old institutions, yet some of the strongest stood firm.
They were, after all, of the same Church, and Church
and Cloister preserved the records of Saxon liberties, and
the customs of Saxon times. The clerical and lay
powers of many Abbesses were handed down unimpaired
to their successors in Norman times. The conquest was
not one of extermination but of superposition. The
great mass of the <i>people</i> remained Saxon in heart. The
Normans were, too, of a kindred race, though they had
come from a long sojourn in a land where language,
thought, and custom had become Latinised, a land that
already held the principles of the Salic Law. William
promised to respect the laws of the country, but there is
no appeal against a conqueror’s will, or a soldier’s
sword.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The lands they wrested from the Saxons, the Normans
held of the King by Feudal Tenure or by Military Service.
Their laws, customs, and language dominated the Saxons,
as did their swords. But only for a time. The struggles
with France formed, through a common antagonism, a
united nation of the varying races in the island. To
complete the union, the nation went back to the
language of the Saxons, and, when opportunity for
freedom called, went back to their old laws as a basis of
the new. That women suffered more than men did
from the Norman invasion might only have been expected.
But that they did not do so nearly to the extent that it
is commonly supposed, can be proved by reference to
competent authorities, by whom the limitations of their
privileges are shown to proceed on definite and comprehensible
lines.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c025'>THE MODERN BASES OF PRIVILEGE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c026'>“All rights arise out of justice.... Justice is a constant and
perpetual will to award to each his right.... Jurisprudence is the
knowledge of divine and human things, the science of what is just
and unjust.”—<span class='sc'>Bracton.</span> <span class='sc'>De Legibus Angliæ.</span>“Of acquiring
the dominion of things.”—<i>Temp. Hen. III.</i></p>
<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>The</span> relation between property and privilege has been
the determining principle in Constitutional Evolution, and
the distinction between the sexes in the matter of Property
has been the radical cause of the distinction between
them in regard to Privilege. It is necessary to trace this.
The custom of Military Tenure made male heirs more
valuable to the Crown than female heirs, inasmuch as
personal service was more effective and reliable than representative
service; and, therefore, in early Norman
days, when all lands lay in the King’s gift, he was eager to
confirm each succeeding son of the last owner in his possessions,
before <i>any</i> of the daughters. But the principles
of justice, the customs of the land, and the springs
of human nature, combined in opposition to a further
exercise of the Royal will, so that <i>all</i> the daughters succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>before any of the collateral heirs, before uncle,
cousin, or nephew. Husbands and fathers would not
have risked their lives freely in the King’s wars, if they
knew that wives and daughters were to lose their estates,
at the same time as they lost the protection of their strong
right arms. A survival of Saxon opinion strangely affected
further the position of daughters, when the chaos of
custom took form in law. An eldest-born son could
inherit to the detriment of his younger brothers, following
the Norman custom of primogeniture, but the eldest-born
daughter held no privilege over her younger sisters, who
were all <i>co-parceners</i> with her as regarded the inheritance,
in the manner that children of both sexes inherited
among the Saxons, and among the representatives of the
Saxons, the free men of Kent. An indivisible inheritance,
such as a title, fell in abeyance among daughters until
decided by the selection of the Crown, though it was
generally granted to the eldest daughter.[<a href='#app-i'>i</a>.] Unless a
woman, therefore, was an only child, she did not succeed
to the entire advantages of “the heir,” but as only child,
and sole heiress, she inherited to the full the rights and
privileges of her father, brother, or ancestor. Sex-in-itself
did not <i>disqualify</i> a woman from anything. There
was no excusing a woman a duty, and <i>consequently</i> no denying
her a privilege. “<i>Essoin de servitio regis</i> lyeth not
where the party is a woman” (Statutes 33, Ed. I.). The
only advantage granted her, that of “sending a deputy,”
she was allowed in common with men, frail or infirm, or
over the age of bearing arms.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The Feudal System has been credited with limiting
Personality and Privilege to males; therefore it startles
some students of history to find that it was only on the
extinction of the Feudal System, and the translation of
service-payments into money-payments, that women lost
the definite place assigned to them. Women’s rights
came second in Feudal Times, because they had to be
protected by men’s swords; women’s rights came nowhere
in later times, when freedom towards property would
have made them able to protect themselves. The encroachments
naturally took place first in regard to
married women. In ancient times even a married
woman could be “free,” both as an inheritor and as an
earner. In the very highest ranks she remained so. She
was free to contract, to sign, to seal, to act as a <i>feme sole</i>.
On her marriage she conferred her title on her husband,
as men did theirs upon their wives. The lands were held
in common. The responsibilities she could not undertake
herself, he fulfilled as her representative. When
she died he lost his representative character; his tenure
of her lands was only “by courtesy,” and that only if he
had a child by her; if not, they reverted at her death to
the donor. (<i>See</i> “Statutes of Realm,” vol. i., p. 220.)
But a widow also could hold her husband’s lands under
certain conditions, either by her marriage settlement, her
husband’s will, the King’s gift, or “the courtesy of England.”
Many examples of widows doing so are given
later. Even where there were heirs, and her husband
died intestate, a widow had a legal right to the third part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of her husband’s property. In Kent she had a right to
the half till she married again, as a man held the half of
his wife’s property till he married again. (<i>See</i> “The
Customal of Kent.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Laws of Chivalry refined the Upper Classes, inculcating
Truth, Loyalty, Chastity, Courtesy, Liberality,
Reverence for Women and Generosity to the Weak. But
the real foundation of Privilege in Chivalric times was
practically Strength, Courage and Success among men.
Beauty, Grace and Honour among women. These qualities
being temporary, were not synonymous with Justice.
The position of Divinity is an unstable one, depending
on the attitude of the worshippers. When Chivalry
faded out of men’s hearts, women felt that the outer
shell of custom meant little. It only set them on the
shelf.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tone of Chivalry affected the hearts of the traders
and manufacturers of Chivalric Times, a tone healthier,
because more founded on justice and equality. There
was even then a confusion of ideas between return-value
of labour abroad, and labour at home; but there was
no confusion about the return-values of similar labour
performed by men or by women. Women were equal in
all social guilds, and trading women were equal in trading
guilds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The notion that partnership in toil could justify the
assumption of the whole proceeds of the common
labours to the use and will of one of the partners did
not dawn on the simpler minds of our ancestors. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>took centuries of mistranslations of the first principles
of government to let this partial idea develop into its
modern complexity. In Prynne’s “Fundamental Rights
of English Freemen,” p. 3, art. 7, we read, “That it is
the ancient and undoubted right of every freeman that
he hath a full and absolute propriety in his goods and
estate. And that no taxes, taillages, loans, benevolences,
or other charge ought to be commanded, imposed, or
levied by the King or his ministers, without <i>common</i> consent
by Act of Parliament.” In order that husbands
might have this absolute proprietary right over the whole
of the common property, it was gradually extinguished
among wives; and the second right for them naturally
lapsed in consequence of the other. The absorption of
a married woman’s property by her husband developed
for her a massive code of legal restrictions, and a stern
doctrine of civil disabilities. She was dissociated first
from property, thence from privilege, finally she became
property. This was but the natural outcome of the non-recognition
of her Personal and Proprietary Rights. In
any history, therefore, of British Freewomen, we must
practically follow legal precedent, in assuming the non-existence
of the <i>feme couverte</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the different principles of inheritance, there
have always been fewer heiresses than heirs; through the
success of the various methods of protecting male professional
and trade industries against female competition,
there have always been fewer female owners of earned
property; through the lower rate of women’s wages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and various causes tending to disable single women
even in the retention of property, these owners represented
smaller incomes than did men of their
own class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Representative Freewomen, therefore, have always been
in a small minority. The dominance of a <i>temporary
majority</i> sends a minority into the Opposition; in which
exile it lays plans for future action, when in the see-saw of
political change its turn comes to rise again. The
majority has always to consider the minority in its
calculations and actions. But a <i>permanent majority</i>,
consciously or unconsciously, labours to oust a <i>permanent
minority</i> from recognised and recognisable existence
even as an Opposition. By <i>always</i> being able to overbear
opinion, it makes the expression of opinion futile.
Either it is concordant and unnecessary, or discordant
and inoperative. The expression of either becomes a
waste of time, and is soon denied. And thus women
have been ousted by degrees from the building up of
the superstructure of the English Constitution, in whose
foundations they had been considered. The privilege of
British Freewomen remained a recognised quantity for
ages. Though that quantity became “small by degrees
and beautifully less,” it was not finally annihilated till
the heart of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c008'>The process of diminution was hastened in periods of
spasmodic activity through association of principles that
should have worked in the opposite direction, had the
principles been understood and applied in their purity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>No doctrine is more antagonistic to the spirit and
teaching of Christ than that of the subjection of women,
and yet, though the change from the Druidic religion to
the worship of Odin affected them but slightly, the
changes within the Christian Creed mark epochs in their
gradual enthralment; as, for instance, the sixteenth
century Reformation and the seventeenth century Revival
On the Suppression of the Monasteries, Abbots
and Abbesses were alike extinguished. But the power
and privilege of the Abbot in the House of Peers as in
the Church, survived in the Bishop. The extinction of
the Abbess, without successor either in Church or State,
took away finally the right of one class of representative
women to sit in the Upper House. The suppression of
the Social and Religious Guilds founded and supported by
women in common with men, gave a seeming reason
for later exclusion of Freewomen from trade guilds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The loudest Puritan cry of the seventeenth century
was, it is true, “No Bishop;” but the practical work
Puritanism was really allowed to do in politics was to
make the representation of women in the Lower House
theoretically impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>As antagonistic to the doctrine of the subjection of
women are the Principles of Liberty. How can men become
truly free that ignore, for others, the liberties founded
on the same reasonings by which they enfranchised themselves?
Yet every great era in the Evolution of so-called
<i>Popular Liberty</i> has been marked by contemporary restrictions
of Feminine Freedom. Hence, in the seventeenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>century, when hereditary serfdom was finally abolished, and
when slavery, by purchase, became impossible in Britain,
we first find the doctrine promulgated that tended to disfranchise
women. When outbursts of fervid eloquence
on “Liberty” were preparing the nation to lay out its
millions in enfranchising even its colonial slaves, in 1832,
the disfranchisement of women was effected by the use
of a single statutory word. When, on the 29th of June,
1867, William Lloyd Garrison, the champion of Negro
Emancipation, was receiving an ovation at St. James’
Hall, men were discussing in St. Stephen’s whether to
give women political existence or not. Though the single
excluding word was erased from the statute book, the
House and the Courts of Law next year determined that
its spirit lingered there. When a new extension of the
Suffrage took place in 1884, the claims of women were
again disallowed. The new rights of men emphasised
more strongly the old wrongs of women. A lowered
qualification for the Franchise protected property, not only
inherited or earned, but that which was only in the process
of earning. This privilege of prospective property increased
the opportunities of earning enormously. But
<i>only</i> when its possession was vested in a man. Women’s
possession of property, more difficult to acquire through
laws of nature, custom, inheritance, marriage, and the
protection of male industries, was further rendered less
stable by their exclusion from the faintest voice in determining
laws, taxation, and home and foreign policy.
The progress of education has enriched public ideas, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>altered the Content of public Conscience, has facilitated
public discussion of facts and theories. The relations of
representation to taxation are assailed. New bases of
privilege are being proposed. There are those who hold
that Property is no sound foundation on which to build a
Constitution. Some would put in its place the notion of
Justice, which others name the right of the Individual.
But those who accept this are divided into two great
classes, the first considering Justice in its own nature, and
treating Individuals as the indivisible units to which
Justice is to be applied, units not to be segregated by
<i>any</i> test into groups receiving Justice or no Justice. The
second class also considers Justice applicable to all
individuals, but adds a rider, that, in their opinion,
<i>individuals can be only masculine</i>. Something in the
construction of their minds permits them to harmonise,
to their own satisfaction, two discordant ideas. Masculinity
seems to them a natural basis of privilege—a
solid foundation of Justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others hold the older doctrines in a modified form,
believing that individuality without qualification of individuals
cannot provide a stable basis. If the idle and
improvident, by mere force of numbers, are to dominate
the industrious and the provident, the ends of justice
would be defeated. By property or industry tests those
are included who have interests to preserve. Those
who help to support the State should have a voice in
determining its action. No one is excluded from Enfranchisement
thereby. A very moderate degree of industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>or success will make it possible to any one to attain the
franchise. A worthy incentive to labour is a moral good.
Amidst these thinkers there are also two classes: those
who consider that the rights of women in themselves, and
in the property they inherit or acquire, are as important as
those of men, and should be made as stable; and those
that, by combining two principles of Enfranchisement,
make a logical cross division, importing the totally unconnected
dividing principle of sex into the consideration of
the rights of property. What is simply <i>unjust</i>, when
individuals are selected on the basis of sex, becomes
both <i>illogical</i> and <i>unjust</i> when questions of sex are imposed
on those of property. Sex is an inseparable
accident, and when accepted as the Basis of Justice,
closes the question; property is a separable accident, and
must be considered upon different lines. The various
objections to any simple, logical, homogeneous, and just
arrangement of the Bases of Privilege, while depending on
the doctrine of sex, are worked out by two sub-sections of
thinkers upon different lines. One section says boldly,
“when persons qualified by property are also qualified by
masculinity, we grant them privilege.” The other section
analyses the attributes of masculinity, and apply each as
a separate test to the person qualified by property.
“The physical force argument is the foundation of
government, most men are stronger than most women,
therefore no women must interfere in government.”
Women would “require an improved understanding to vote
for a member of Parliament.” “Women cannot understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>mathematics, nor master the classics,” and when they proved
they could, the principle was sent back further into statements
that “their brains were not heavy enough,” “their
moral force not strong enough.” “Women have not written
Shakespeare, composed Beethoven, painted Raphael,
built St. Peter’s.” The understanding of proportional
representation, and the far-reaching economic results of
bi-metallism, have been seriously proposed as tests for
women. But have the whole series, or <i>any one of them</i>,
ever been applied to the mere male electors of the realm?
When pressed hard on this point, these objectors, in their
confusion, fall back upon precedent and on authority to
prove that to be <i>legal</i> which they cannot prove to be
<i>just or reasonable</i>. It is no argument in favour of anything
that <i>it has been</i>, or else reformation would be
impossible. But when the sole argument against its
<i>being</i> is that it <i>has not been</i>, the consideration of Legality
and of Precedent becomes a necessity to the advocates of
Justice. Many mistakes have been taken for facts, many
fallacious arguments based upon erroneous premises. A
Review of the History of Women that have hitherto ever
exercised any privilege is necessary for generalisations to
be based thereon. For by this process we may unite the
followers of Legality and Precedent with the worshippers
of Justice and Equality, and the union of the two forces,
like those of the sun and moon upon the sea, may raise
the high “tide in the affairs of women that leads on to
fortune.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Review is encouraging in two aspects. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>light of the modern doctrine of Heredity, we see that
our far-away ancestors held opinions to which we may
hope that our successors may yet <i>revert</i>; and from
Ancient History we find that a recognition of the existence
of women in the State, far from being novel or revolutionary,
would only be the fulfilling of the fundamental
principles of the English Constitution.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>In</span> order to simplify and classify the mass of material
at hand, it is advisable to take by their degree the ranks
of women among the Anglo-Normans. Among the
Queens, only because they precede in order of time and
of number, we may take first</p>
<p class='c008'><b>Queens Consort.</b>—In Doomsday Book, Matilda, the
wife of the Conqueror, is entered as holding of the
King, many lands forfeited by the Saxons. “She was
made the feudal possessor of the lands of Beortric, Earl
of Gloucester, hence the practice of settling the Lordship
of Bristol on the Queen generally, prevailed for centuries.
On her death in 1083, her lands went back to the King
by feudal tenure. The Conqueror kept them in his own
hands, meaning them for his and her youngest son Henry,
who afterwards succeeded.” (Seyer’s “Memoirs of
Bristol,” chap. iv., p. 318). Later queens had separate
establishments, officers and privy purse. “The Aurum
Reginæ, or Queen’s Gold, is distinguished from all other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>debts and duties belonging to the Queen of this Realme.
All other revenues proceed to her from the grace of the
King, this by the common law ... which groweth upon
all fines paid to the King, licenses, charters, pardons, of
which she receives one-tenth part. After her death the
King recovers his right to hold this tenth. This duty
hath been enjoyed by the Queens from Eleanor, wife of
Henry II. to Anne, second wife of Henry VIII.”
(Hakewell’s speech in Parliament on Aurum Reginæ.
Addit. MSS., Brit. Mus. 25, 255.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Even to our own days Queens Consort have had the
privilege of acting as <i>femes soles</i>. But in early times they
exercised considerably more power in the State than we
realise to-day. They sat in the Councils, even in the presence
of the Kings, and gave their consent to measures along
with Kings and Nobles. “The Queen-wife of England also
superscribed her name <i>over</i> their warrants or letters of
public direction or command, although in the time of
Henry VIII. the fashion was that the queens wrote their
names over the left side of the first line of such warrants,
and not <i>over</i> them as <i>the Kings do</i>” (Selden’s “Titles of
Honour”). But as many of the Queens Consort, though
thus entitled to be ranked among “Freewomen,” were
not of native extraction; we do not dwell upon all their
privileges, preferring to hasten on to those that indubitably
were British Freewomen.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Queens Regnant.</b>—The first critical moment in the
History of Queens Regnant occurs at the death of
Henry I., who had, as he considered, arranged satisfactorily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>for the succession of his daughter Matilda.
His attempt proved that the French Salic Law had not
been made law in England. A quaint account of his
proceeding occurs in the “Lives of the Berkeleys,”
published by the Gloucester Archæological Society, 1835,
p. 2. “King Harri the first, third sonne of King
William the Conqueror, had issue remaining one daughter
named Maude ... the sayd King Harri send for his
foresayd daughter Maude the Emparice into England,
and in open Parliament declared and ordeyned her to
bee his eire. To whom then and there were sworen all
the lordes of England, and made unto her sewte, admittinge
her for his eire. Amongs whom principally and
first was sworen Stephen Earle of Boleyn, nevowe of the
sayd King Harri the first.” But as Selden says, “I do
very well know, that our perjured barons, when they
resolved to exclude Queen Maud from the English
throne, made this shameful pretence, ‘that it would be
a shame for so many nobles to be subject to one
woman.’ And yet you shall not read, that the Iceni,
our Essex men got any shame by that Boadicea, whom
Gildas terms a lioness” (Janus Anglorum). The
same author, in noting the laws made by various kings,
enters the reign of Stephen as that of an unrighteous
king who had no time to make laws for the protection
of the kingdom, because he had to fight in defence of
his own unjust claim. “In 1136 Henry of England
died, and Stephen Earl of Boulogne succeeded. At
Mass on the Day of his Coronation, by some mistake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the peace of God was forgotten to be pronounced on the
people” (“Antiquitates,” Camden). Prynne calls him
“the perjured usurping King Stephen.” The general
uncertainty of the succession is betokened in the struggle.
Very probably had there not been a Stephen to stir up
the nobles, the country might have rested peaceably
under the rule of Matilda.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems strange that the oldest Charters of the
express Creation of the title of Comes (Count or
Earl) are those of Queen Maud, who first created
the Earldom of Essex and the Earldom of Hereford.
To Aubrey de Vere also she granted the Earldom
of Cambridge, or another title if he preferred it, and he
chose the Earldom of Oxford. A struggle like the Wars
of the Roses was closed by the death of Stephen and
the peaceable succession of Matilda’s son, Henry II.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another lady of the family was supplanted by the
proverbially “cruel uncle.” King John in 1202 made
prisoners of his nephew, Arthur, Duke of Brittany, and
the Princess Eleanor, his sister, called “The Beauty of
Brittany.” Arthur is supposed to have been murdered
by his uncle, and Eleanor was confined for forty years
in Bristol Castle. A true daughter of Constance, she is
said to have possessed a high and invincible spirit, and to
have constantly insisted on her right to the throne,
which was probably the reason that she spent her life in
captivity. (<i>See</i> the close Rolls of the Tower of London,
and the Introduction xxxv.)</p>

<p class='c008'>But the second real crisis was that which closed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Wars of the Roses. Another Stephen appeared in
Henry VII., who, fortunately for the people, simplified
matters by marrying Elizabeth of York, the rightful heir.
Jealous in the extreme of his wife’s prerogative, he used
his high hand as the conqueror of Richard and the
Kingdom, delayed her coronation as long as he dared,
ignored her in his councils, and magnified his relation
as husband, to the extinction of her glory as Queen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry VIII. enjoyed to the full the advantage of an undisputed
succession. He restricted the rights of Queens
Consort, as his father had ignored the rights of Queens
Regnant. A strange Nemesis followed, foretold in the
so-called prophecies of Merlin. That these really were
talked of, before the events occurred, can be proved
by MSS. among the uncalendared papers temp. Henry
VIII. Public Record Office. There is in full “the Examination
of John Ryan of St. Botolphs, Fruiterer,
concerning discourses which he heard at the Bell
on Tower Hill, Prophecies of Merlin, that there never
again would be King crowned of England after
the King’s son Prince Edward, 22nd August, 1538.”
James V. of Scotland had sadly said on his death-bed,
“The Kingdom came with a lass, and it will go with
a lass.” So was it to be in England. The pale sickly
youth who succeeded, third of the Tudors, died without
wife or child, and on the steps of the throne stood four
royal women, whose lives form the most interesting
period of national history. Each of them had a special
claim. Mary, pronounced illegitimate by the Protestant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>party, and by statute of Parliament, inherited through
her father’s <i>will</i> alone; Elizabeth, pronounced illegitimate
by the Catholic party, and by a similar statute,
stood second in that will; Mary, Queen of Scotland and
of France, showed flawless descent from Margaret, the
elder sister of Henry VIII.; and Lady Jane Grey
proved like flawless descent from Mary, Henry’s younger
sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry, a despot even “by his dead hand,” had, failing
Edward, left the crown to Mary, then to Elizabeth, then
to Lady Jane Grey. Edward VI., not a minor by the
laws of England that allowed Government to commence
at fourteen years, considered both his sisters illegitimate
under his father’s statutes, preferring of the two
Elizabeth’s claim. But for the peace of the kingdom he
left by <i>will</i> the crown to Lady Jane Grey, ignoring, as
his father had done, the prior claims of Mary, Queen of
Scotland and of France. The results of the complication
are too well known to be here rehearsed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first act of Mary was to establish her own legitimacy,
the honour of her mother, and the power of the
Pope; her second was to establish the office of Queen
Regnant “by Statute to be so clear that none but the
malitious and ignorant could be induced and persuaded
unto this Error and Folly to think that her Highness
coulde ne should have enjoye and use such like Royal
Authoritie ... nor doo ne execute and use all things
concerning the Statute (in which only the name of the
King was expressed) as the Kinges of this Realme, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>most noble Progenitours have heretofore doon, used and
exercised” (1 Mar., c. iii.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Both she and her sister, at their coronations, were
girt with the sword of State, and invested with the
spurs of knighthood, to show that they were military
as well as civil rulers. Fortunately for her country,
and for herself, Elizabeth lived and died a maiden
Queen. The bitter consequences of her sister’s Spanish
alliance taught her the importance of independence
as a ruler. Whatever we may individually think of
her character, all must allow her reign to have been in
every way the most brilliant in the history of our country,
only equalled in our own times by that of a Matron
Queen, who has held the reins of Government in her own
hand and whose husband came to the land but as Prince
Consort. Queen Anne’s reign is also worthy of note,
and can bear comparison with that of most Kings,
for its military successes, and its literary activities.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Queens Regent.</b>—Selden argues against Bodin of
Anjou, who upheld the Salic Law, “are not discretion
and strength, courage, and the arts of Government more
to be desired and required in those who have the tuition
of kings in their minority, than in the kings themselves
till they are come of age?” He considers the French
use of Queens as Regents to be destructive of their own
theories.</p>

<p class='c008'>Queens as Regent-Tutors of young kings have not held
the same position in England as they did in France or in
Scotland. But as governing Regents and Viceroys they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>have often done good service. William of Normandy
more than once left the country in charge of his Queen.
Richard I., by commission, appointed his mother,
Eleanor, to be Regent of the Kingdom in his absence,
and wrote to her to find the money for his ransom when
imprisoned abroad. She sat as Judge in the Curia Regis,
taking her seat on the King’s Bench by right of her
office. She granted concessions to the inhabitants of
Oléron (to women as to men) even down to the reign of
John (1 John; <i>see</i> “Rymer’s Fœdera”). Edward III.
found his Queen Philippa a Queen Regent worthy of
himself. Henry V. appointed his mother as Regent in
his absence, and even Henry VIII., when he went
abroad on his last French War, left his Queen, Catherine
Parr, Governor of the Kingdom. I have gone through
their correspondence in the Public Record Office, and it
bears ample testimony to her capability and his trust in
her judgment. In “Olive <i>versus</i> Ingram,” 1739, it is
noted, “Queen Caroline was once appointed Regentor
of the Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was with little less than Vice Regal splendour and
power that Joan, Dowager Countess of Pembroke,
ruled the Palatinate for nine years in the reign of
Edward I.; or Isabel de Burgo in that of Edward II.,
or Agnes de Hastings in that of Edward III.; ruling in
the stead of their sons until the youths attained majority
at the age of twenty-one.</p>

    <div>“Noblesse Oblige.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>In</span> Selden’s “Titles of Honour,” iii., 890, he says, “Of
feminine titles some are immediately created in women,
some are communicated by their husbands, others are
transmitted to them from their ancestors, and some also
are given them as consequents only of the dignity of
their husbands and parents.” Of “immediate creation”
he gives the example of Margaret, Countess of Norfolk,
created by Richard II. Duchess of Norfolk, wherein the
investiture is mentioned by the patent to be by putting
on her the cap of honour “recompensatio meritorum.”
Henry VIII. created Anne Boleyn Marchioness of
Pembroke. James I. created Lady Mary Compton the
Countess of Buckingham in her husband’s lifetime, without
permitting him to share the honour. He also
created Lady Finch, first Viscountess of Maidstone, and
afterwards Countess of Winchilsea, limiting inheritance
to heirs of her body.</p>
<p class='c008'>Anne Bayning, wife of James Murray, was created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Viscountess Bayning of Foxley in 1674. Several titles
have been granted for discreditable causes, too few for
“recompensatio meritorum.” Men that were merely
rich have been made peers. Women that have been
truly noble have not been made Noble by Letters Patent.
The Baroness Burdett Coutts is the only modern
example I can recal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The titles that women received from their husbands
were doubtless intended more as an honour to their
husbands than to themselves, though they carried, at
times, considerable privileges along with them. They
bore them as widows until their death, sometimes with
the full honours and powers their husbands had borne.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are some curious cases of titles being <i>assigned</i>.
Randol, Earl of Chester and Lincoln, granted the Earldom
of Lincoln to his sister, the Lady Hawise de
Quency. She afterwards granted the title to John de
Lacy, who had married her daughter Margaret, a grant
confirmed by the King in a charter, limiting the inheritance
to the heirs of Margaret.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already noted the two limitations of a daughter’s
inheritance of property. The same affected titles. But
having inherited, she became endowed with every privilege
to the full; and every duty was exacted of her to the
utmost.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Women paid Homage.</b>—In spite of many careless
remarks to the contrary, women paid homage. “John,
heir of the Devereux, died under age; his sister Joane,
making proof of her age, and doing her homage, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Livery of the Lands of her Inheritance” (2 Ric. II., Dugdale,
117).</p>

<p class='c008'>The summons to Ladies as well as to Lords for aids
to the King was “de fide et homagio.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that at some periods widows did not pay
Homage for the lands of their deceased husbands; but
neither then did men pay Homage for the lands of their
deceased wives, holding only by “the Courtesy of
England.” “Because if Homage be given, it might
never return to the lawful heir” (“Statutes of the Realm,
Lands held by Courtesy,” vol. i., p. 220).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Received Homage.</b>—Many examples are given in the
“Rotuli Hundredorum,” “Testa de Nevil” and “Kirkby’s
Inquest.” Isabella and Idonea de Veteripont insisted
on Fealty and Homage from the inhabitants of Appleby.
4 Edward I., as did Anne Clifford later (Nicholson’s
“History of Westmoreland,” v. 2). One curious distinction
comes in here between the sexes, as a result of
the system of <i>coparceny</i> among sisters. A brother might
pay Homage to his brother, but not a sister to her sister.
The statute of 20 Henry III. (1236) enacted that “the
law regarding sisters, co-heirs, be used for Ireland as in
England, that the eldest sister only pay Homage to the
Overlord or to the King in her own name and that of
her sisters, but that the sisters do not pay Homage to
the sister for that would be to make her Seigneuress over
the other sisters” (Rot. Parl., 20 Henry III.).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could hold Courts Baron.</b>—A petition, 16 Richard
II., appears, praying that no Liegeman should be <i>compelled</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to appear at the Courts and Councils of the Lord or of
the Lady to reply for his freehold.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Rot. Hundred, Edward I., many women were
entered as holding Courts of Frank-pledge and Assizes of
Bread and Ale, and as having a Gallows in their Jurisdiction,
as Johanna de Huntingfeud held view of Frank-pledge
in the Hundred of Poppeworth, Canterbury, vol.
i., p. 53. Elena de la Zouche also, Agnes de Vescy, and
Elena de Valtibus in Dorsetshire, the Countess of Leycester
at Essedon in Buckinghamshire. (“Relation of
Women to the State in past times.” Helen Blackburn,
<i>National Review</i>, Nov., 1886.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The Countess Lucy kept her Courts at Spalding during
the banishment of her first husband, Yvo de Taillebois.
(Selby’s “Genealogist,” 1889, p. 70.) The Pipe Roll of
31 Hen. I. shows that she had agreed to pay the King
100 marks for the privilege of administering justice
among her tenants (homines).</p>

<p class='c008'>In Anne Clifford’s Diary, Harl. M.S., 6177, appears:
“1650. This time of my staying in Westmoreland, I
employed myself in building and reparation at Skipton
and Barden Towers, and in causing ye bounds to be
ridden and my Courts kept in my sundry mannors in
Craven....”</p>

<p class='c008'>“1653. In the beginning of this year did I cause
several Courts to be kept in my name in divers of my
mannors in this Country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“1659. And ye Aprill after, did I cause my old
decayed Castle of Brough to be repaired, and also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Tower called the Roman Tower in ye said Castle, and a
Court-House for keeping of my Courts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is preserved in Swansea a charter granted,
2 Edward III., to Aliva, wife of John de Mowbray, of
the land of Gower. It recites and confirms various previous
charters of the land of Gower, with the appurtenances,
and <i>all manner of Jurisdictions</i>, and all Royal
Liberties, and free customs which Gilbert de Clare the
son of Richard de Clare theretofore Earl of Gloucester
and Hertford had, in his land of Glamorgan. (Report
of Municipal Corporations, 1835, p. 383.)</p>

<p class='c008'>This practice seems to have long survived in modified
forms. In same Report, p. 2850, regarding the Borough
of Ruthin, “It was in evidence, and was indeed frankly
admitted by the deputy-steward, that, upon impanelling
the jury at the Borough Court Leet it is the uniform
practice for some agent of the Lady of the Manor to address
a letter, which is delivered to the foreman of the jury
in their retiring-room, recommending two persons as aldermen,
who are invariably elected. As a part of this system,
it was proved that in many instances the duties and fees
payable on the admission of burgesses to their freedom
had been defrayed by the Lady of the Manor; and that
the uncontrolled power of impanelling the jury was left
to her agent. The only answer furnished by the deputy-steward
was that he had taken for his guide the usage of
the place, as pursued by his predecessors, without reference
to charters, which had only of late years come under
discussion.” Also in page 2840, regarding Rhuddlan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“As far as any ruling body or corporation can be said to
subsist in a borough thus circumstanced, the Lady of the
Manor must be considered to elect that body; for the
Steward of the Court Leet is appointed by her during
pleasure; and he gives the constables a list of the persons
who are to serve on the jury by whom the two
bailiffs, the only subsisting officers of the corporation, are
chosen.” The Lady of the Manor there also paid the
Constables.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Held by Military Service.</b>—There were 15 ladies summoned
for military service against Wales “de fide et
homagio,” in 5 Edward I., and again in 10 Edward I.
Among these were Devorgilla de Balliol, Agnes de Vescy,
Dionysia de Monte Canisio, and Margaret de Ros. A writ
was issued to Isabella de Ros, commanding her “in fide
et homagio” to send her service to the muster at Portsmouth
for the King’s expedition to Gascony, 14th June,
1234. Elena de Lucy was summoned from the county
of Northampton “to perform military service in parts beyond
the sea. Muster at London, 7th July, 25 Edward I.”
Joan Disney of Lincoln was summoned “to perform
military service against the Scots. Muster at London,
7th July, 25 Edward I.” These are but a few selected
from many others that appear in Palgrave’s Parliamentary
Writs. It is true that a substitute might be
sent by anyone, <i>male or female</i>, with reasonable excuse.
“On 16th April, 1303, proclamation was made that all
prelates, persons of religion, women and persons who were
unfit for military service, who were willing to commute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>their service by fines, might appear before the Barons of
the Exchequer at York on 17th May ensuing. Otherwise
they, or their substitutes, must appear at the muster
at Berwick on the 26th May.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Palgrave’s Parliamentary Writs give long lists of women
holding castles, towns, and military feods in 9 Edward
II., and Harl. MS., 4219, in “Hundreds, Civitates,
Burgi, and Villæ in Comitatu Norfolk et <i>Domini</i> eorundem,”
gives many names of women.</p>

<p class='c008'>Margaret, widow of Lord Edmund Mortimer, was
charged with providing one hundred men for the wars in
Scotland out of her lands at Key and Warthenon.
Dugdale’s “Peerage and Baronetage,” vol. i., p. 173.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 3 Edward II. writs docketed “De summonicione
servicii Regis” were issued to Abbots and Abbesses alike
for military aid against the Scots, “de fide et dilectione;”
and to Nobles, Lords and Ladies alike in “fide et
homagio.” On the 13th September following Domina
Maria de Graham proffers the service of two knights’
fees for all her lands in England, performed by four
servants with four barded horses; and many noble ladies
offer equivalent service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joane Plantagenet, the Fair Maid of Kent, inherited
from her brother the Earldom of Kent, and from her
mother the Barony of Wake, by which she was styled
the Lady of Wake. She married Sir Thomas de Holland,
who, through her, became Earl of Kent without
creation. Her son Thomas succeeded both. His widow
Alicia died possessed of 27 manors held by direct feudal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>or military tenure, beside many freeholds. (<i>See</i> “Inquisitions
Post Mortem”; 4 Henry IV.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could be Knights.</b>—Not only in Romances, not
only in Spenser’s “Faery Queene,” but in books of
Chivalry, we may see that women could be knights.
Mary and Elizabeth were made knights before they were
made Queens. Abergavenny Castle was held by knight’s
service. William, Baron Cantilupe, by marrying Eva,
daughter and co-heir of William, Lord Braose, obtained
the Castle and Lands. Her tomb in St. Mary’s Church,
Abergavenny, 1246, is of interest as being the earliest
stone effigy of a woman known in England. Her
daughter, Eva de Cantilupe, succeeded to the barony
and the castle, and was a knight. Her tomb is the only
instance known of the stone effigy of a woman adorned
with the insignia of knighthood, 1247. In 1589, Edward
Neville sued for the Barony against Mary, Lady Fane, as
being entailed in the Heir Male. His suit was refused.
The Lord Chief-Justice Popham determined “that there
was no right at all in the Heir Male; the common
Custom of England doth wholly favour the Heir General
... and Her Majesty would require to make a new
creation to prefer the Heir Male to the Heir Female”
(Sir Harris Nicolas’ “Historic Peerages,” p. 15).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Inherited Public Office associated with the Title or
Property.</b>—The story of Ela of Salisbury illustrates the
views with which the early Normans regarded heiresses.
She was born in 1188. Her father, the Earl of Salisbury,
died 1196, leaving her sole heir. She inherited both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>title and lands before his three brothers. Her mother
conveyed her away secretly to a castle in Normandy, to
save her from possible dangers during her minority. An
English knight, William Talbot, romantically undertook,
as a troubadour, to discover her whereabouts, and, after
two years, brought her back to England. King Richard
betrothed her as a royal ward to his half-brother, William
Longespée, son of Fair Rosamund, who became, through
her, Earl of Salisbury. At King John’s coronation at
Westminster, William, Earl of Salisbury, is noted as
being present among the throng of nobility. (<i>See</i> “Roger
Hoveden.”) He died 1226, leaving four sons and four
daughters. Though besieged with suitors, Ela preferred
a “free widowhood” to selecting another Earl Salisbury.
When her son came of age he claimed investiture of the
Earldom, but the King refused it <i>judicialiter</i>, by the
advice of the Judges, and according to the dictates of
Law. The Earldom and the government of the Castle
of Sarum were vested in Ela, not in her dead
husband.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The office of Sheriff of Wiltshire</b>, her right by inheritance,
she exercised in person until 21 Hen. II., when,
probably to facilitate her son’s entrance into the Earldom,
she retired as Abbess to the Abbey of Lacock, founded
by herself. Even then, however, the youth did not
receive the title, and she survived both son and grandson.
The note to this Biography adds, “Though the law of
female descent, as applied to baronies by writ, has long
ceased to govern the descent of earldoms, it certainly did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>during the first centuries after the Norman conquest.”
(Bowle’s “History of Lacock Abbey.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Isabella and Idonea de Veteripont, who afterwards
married Roger de Clifford, and Roger de Leybourn
jointly held the office of <b>High Sheriff of Westmoreland</b>,
and insisted on the Burghers bringing their cases to them
personally, 15 Ed. I. The office was held afterwards,
also in person, during the reigns of the Stuarts, by the
brave Anne de Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke,
and Montgomery, and Baroness of Westmoreland. In
virtue of her office, she sat on the Bench of Justices in
the Court of Assizes at Appleby. (Durnford and East’s
“Term Reports,” p. 397; Nicholson’s “History of
Westmoreland,” vol. ii., p. 20.) “As the King came out
of Scotland, when he lay at York, there was a striffe
between my father and my Lord Burleigh, who was then
President, who should carie the sword; but it was adjudged
to my father’s side, because it was his Office by
Inheritance, and so it is lineally descended on me”
(Anne Clifford’s Diary, Harl. MSS., 6177). We may
add here, though belonging properly to the following
chapter, a parallel case:</p>

<p class='c008'>“William Balderstone had two co-heiresses, Isabel and
Jane. Isabel married Sir Robert Harrington of Hornby,
and Jane, first Sir Ralph Langton, and second Sir John
Pilkington. When Jane was “the young widow” of Sir
Ralph Langton, in 1462, she, along with her sister
Isabella and Sir Robert Harrington, her sister’s husband,
appeared in court to vindicate their right to the offices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of the <b>Baylywicks of the Wapentakes</b> of Amoundernes
and Blakeburnshire, peacefully occupied by their ancestors
time out of mind, and claimed by one Giles Beeston, on
the plea of Letters Patent. Giles not appearing, judgment
was given in their favour, and a precept issued accordingly
to the Sheriff at the Castle of Leicester, 28th
May, 2 Ed. IV. (Townley MSS.; “History of Whalley,”
vol. ii., p. 358, 4th edition, 1876, by Whittaker.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The word, Bailiwick, was then applied to the office of
a Sheriff. (<i>See</i> 4 Henry IV., c. v.; Statutes, vol. ii.)
“Every Sheriff of England shall reside within his
Bailiwick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guy de Beauchamp, late Earl of Warwick, held the
manor of Southanton as of inheritance from his deceased
wife, Alicia, by the Sergeanty of bearing a Rod before the
Justices in Eyre in the county. (9 Edward II.; Blount’s
Tenures.”)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Marshal.</b>—Isabel de Clare, only daughter of Richard
de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, brought the Earldom into
the family of the Marshals of England by marrying
William le Marshal. She had five sons (each of whom
succeeded to the Office, without leaving an heir) and five
daughters. The eldest of these, Maud, Countess of
Norfolk, received as her share of the family property the
Castles of Strigail and Cuniberg, and, with them, the
office of Marshal, and in the 30th Hen. III. “received
Livery by the King himself of the Marshal’s Rod, being
the eldest who by inheritance ought to enjoy that great
Office by descent from Walter Marischal sometime the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Earl of Pembroke. Whereupon the Lord Treasurer and
the Barons of the Exchequer had command to cause her
to have all rights thereto belonging and to admit of such
a deputy to sit in the Exchequer for her as she should
assign.” (Dugdale Peerage, vol. i., p. 77.) Her son Roger
exercised it during the remainder of her life and succeeded
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alicia de Bigod, his widow, succeeded him in his
honour. I find among the petitions to the Council of
35 Edward I, held in Carlisle, one of “Alicia de Bygod
Comitissa Mareschall” to be allowed to send two proxies
to the Parliament of the King, “posuit loco suo, Johem
Bluet militem, vel Johem de Fremlingham ad sequend
pro dote sua coram Rege et consilio suo.” This must
have been granted, for these proxies do appear in her
name in the Parliament Roll of 35 Edward I. But she
was summoned by writ personally (22nd January), in
right of her office, to meet Edward II. and his bride at
Dover on or about 4th February. (1 Edward II.; Palgrave’s
“Parliamentary Writs.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>The office of Marshal and title of Earl of Norfolk were
afterwards given “in tail general” to Thomas Brotherton,
son of Edward I. and brother of Edward II. His
daughter, Margaret, inherited the office with the title and
arms, as she appears as “Margaret Countess Marshal” in
the Parliament Roll of 1 Richard II. (Rot. Parl., 713.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the petition of John, Earl Marshal, for precedence
over Earl Warwick, he says that “Thomas of Brotherton
was son of Edward I., and bore the Royal arms. Of him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>came Margaret, of whom came Elizabeth, of whom came
Thomas, of whom came John, now Erle Mareschal, and
so apperteneth ye said place in yis Riall court to this Lord
Earl Mareschal by cause of the blode and armes Riall with
ye said possession” (Rot Parl., iii. Henry VI.). The office
afterwards fell to the Mowbrays. Anne Mowbray,
heiress, married the young Duke of York, second son
of Edward IV., at the age of four years. She carried the
office of Marshal to him, but he died in the Tower with
his brother, Edward V., and his uncle seized the title.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Adeline de Broc held possession of her Guildford
estates by the service of being <b>Marshal in the King’s
court.</b> (Temp. Henry II.; Blount’s Tenures.”) “It was
adjudged in B.R., Car I., that the Office of Marshal of
that Court well descended to a <i>feme</i>, and that she might
exercise it by deputy if she pleased.” (Callis, 250.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>High Constable.</b>—Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford
and Essex, held the manors of Harlefield, Newnam,
and Whytenhurst, County Gloucester, by the service of
High Constable. He left two daughters, but the elder,
Eleanor, succeeded to the office, which she conveyed to
her husband, Thomas of Woodstock, who exercised it
for her; the younger sister, Mary, marrying Henry
Plantagenet of Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry IV.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>High Steward.</b>—Henry, Earl of Leicester, through the
Barony of Hinckley held the office of High Steward of
England. He died, leaving two daughters, the elder of
whom, having married abroad, left the dignity free to
her sister, who married John of Gaunt, fourth son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Edward III. Through her right he exercised the office
of Steward, which their son, Henry IV., carried back to
the Crown.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>High Chamberlain.</b>—Justice Ashurst, from the King’s
Bench in 1788, notes that women have served the office
of High Chamberlain (Rex <i>v.</i> Stubbs). I have not yet
found the name of the lady that he refers to; but we all
know that the Baroness Willoughby d’Eresby held the
Office down to our own times, though she allowed her
son to exercise it as her deputy. “Catherine, sole
daughter and heir to the last Lord Willoughby d’Eresby,
became 4th wife to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.
She afterwards married Thomas Bertie, and her son was
Peregrine, Lord Willoughby d’Eresby, who married Mary,
daughter of the Earl of Oxford, whose son Robert (1 Jac.
I.) inherited the title and Office of High Chamberlain.”
(Dugdale.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Manor of Hornmede, Hertforde, the Lady
Lora de Laundford holds as a Serjeanty of our Lord the
King by being Chamberlain to our Lady the Queen.”
(7 Edward I., Rot., 39.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Ela, third daughter of Ela of Salisbury, foundress of
Lacock, in 1285 was returned as holding the Manor of
Hoke-Norton in Oxfordshire <i>in capite</i> by the Serjeanty
of carving before our Lord the King on Christmas Day,
when she had for her fee the King’s knife with which she
cut. (Placit Coron., 13 Edward I., Rot., 30. Bowle’s
“Annals of Lacock Abbey,” p. 160.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Champion.</b>—The Manor of Scrivelby was held by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Dymocks on condition of the possessor acting as King’s
Champion. When the heiress, Margaret, inherited the
property, she inherited the Office, which her son, Thomas
Dymock, performed for her at the coronation of Henry IV.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The office of Champion at the last coronation was
in a woman, who applied in that case to make a deputy.”
(<i>See</i> “Olive <i>versus</i> Ingram,” 1739, and Co. Litt, 107.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could be Governors of Royal Castles.</b>—Isabella
de Fortibus held the Borough and Camp of Plympton,
and governed the Isle of Wight. In 8 and 9 Edward II.
there was a settlement of Hugo de Courtenay’s petition
to succeed to his kinswoman Isabella de Fortibus in
governance of the Isle of Wight, etc. Isabella de Vesci
held the Castles of Bamborough and Scarborough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nicholaa de la Haye held Lincoln for the King.
“And after the war it befell that the Lord the King
(John) came to Lincoln, and the Lady Nicholaa came
forth from the western gate of the castle, carrying the
keys of the castle in her hand, and met the said Lord
King John and offered him the keys as Lord; and said
she was a woman of great age, and had endured many
labours and anxieties in that castle, and she could bear
no more. And the Lord the King returned them to her
sweetly, and said. Bear them, if you please, yet awhile.”
This story appears in that Royal Commission of Inquiry
into the condition of the country named the “Rotuli
Hundredorum.” The King was desirous to persuade so
steadfast an adherent to continue to hold “in time of
peace and in time of war” what, in those disturbed days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was one of the most important fortresses of the kingdom.
For Nicholaa de la Haye and Gerard de Camville her
husband had stood by King John in all his troubles;
their attachment to him before he was King had brought
suspicions and confiscations upon them. Gerard had to
pay a heavy sum to Richard I. to be repossessed of his
own estate, while Nicholaa paid the King three hundred
marks for leave to marry her daughter to whom she
would, provided it was not to an enemy of the King.
After the death of Richard, Gerard de Camville was reinstated
as Governor of Lincoln Castle, during the
remainder of his life, and at his death John transferred
the appointment to his wife, “a lady eminent in those
days,” says Dugdale. She continued at her post, and the
King also appointed her Sheriff of Lincoln. In 1217
the partisans of Louis the Dauphin laid siege to Lincoln.
Though the town sided with the besiegers, though 600
knights and 20,000 foot soldiers came to reinforce them,
Nicholaa continued her defence of the castle till the Earl
of Pembroke arrived with an army to her relief. In the
next year she was again appointed Sheriff of Lincoln by
Henry III. But this closed her public career, and she
died in peace at Swaynston in 1229. (“Sketches from
the Past,” <i>Women’s Suffrage Journal</i>, March, 1888.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Several Charters in one of the Duchy of Lancaster’s
Cowcher Books, prove that the Constableship of Lincolnshire,
the Wardenship of Lincoln Castle, and the Barony
of Eye or Haia, always went together. They belonged
successively to Robert de Haia, Richard de Haia, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Nicholaa de Haia, who became the wife of Gerarde de
Camville.” (Selby’s “Genealogist,” 1889, p. 170.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could also be appointed to various Offices.</b>—As
Nicholaa de la Haye was made <b>Sheriff</b>, so was the wise
and renowned Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond,
made <b>Justice of the Peace</b> in the reign of Henry VII.;
and the Lady of Berkeley under Queen Mary held the
same office. Lady Russell had been appointed Custodian
of Donnington Castle for her life, at a Salary of one
pound and twopence halfpenny a day, but for Contempt
of her Overlord, she was tried in the Star Chamber,
Mich., 4 James I. (<i>See</i> “Moore’s Law-Cases.”)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could act as Femes Soles when married, or as
Partners.</b>—The Countess Lucy [<a href='#app-ii'>ii</a>.] was one of the few
Saxon heiresses that carried her property down into
Norman times. She had three Norman husbands, Ivo
de Tailleboys, Earl of Anjou, Roger Fitzgerald de
Romar, and Ranulph, Earl of Chester. Among the
various Charters to the Monastery of Spalding are two,
granting and confirming the grant of the Manor of Spalding
to the Monks there. The exact words of the second
Charter are these, “I, Lucy Countess of Chester, give
and grant to the Church and Monks of St. Nicholas of
Spallingis with Soc and Sac, and Thol and Them, with
all its Customs, and with the liberties with which I best
and most freely held in the time of Ivo Tailleboys and
Roger Fitzgerald and the Earl Ranulph my Lords in
almoign of my soul, for the Redemption of the soul of
my father and of my mother, and of my Lords and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>relatives,” etc. “Inspeximus by Oliver Bishop of
London 1284.” (Selby’s “Genealogist,” p. 70, 71.)
In the lives of the Berkeleys, from the Berkeley
MSS., 1883, published for the Bristol and Gloucester
Archæological Society, some interesting particulars
are given of the Lady Joane, daughter of Earl Ferrars
and Derby, and wife of Lord Thomas of Berkeley,
second of the name. “It appears by divers deeds that
in the xxvith yeare of Edward the first, as in other
yeares, this lady by hir deeds contracted with Richard
de Wike and others as if she had been a <i>feme sole</i>; and
for her seale constantly used the picture of herself holding
in her right hand the escutcheon of her husband’s
arms, the chevron without the crosses; and in her left
hand the escutcheon of her father’s family, circumscribed
Sigilla Johannæ de Berklai,” vol i., p. 206.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elizabeth, Lady of Clare, had buried three husbands,
and had retained her maiden name through their time
as holding the honour and the Castle of Clare,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c023'><sup>[2]</sup></a> which
she inherited on the death of her brother, the last Earl
of Gloucester and Hereford, at Bannockburn. Her
daughter, Elizabeth de Burgh, married her cousin Lionel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>third son of Edward III., in whom the Earldom of Clare
became the Dukedom of Clarence.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The petition of her “humble Chapeleyns Priour et chanoyns
de sa priourie de Walsingham,” that she would not allow the Franciscan
friars to settle in their neighbourhood, is communicated by
the Rev. James Lee-Warner of Norwich to the <i>Archæological
Journal</i>, vol. xxvi., p. 167 (1869). One reason they bring forward
is that if the intruders were to propose an indemnity, it could
only be “par serment, ou par gages, ou par plegges,” and that
such security is of no avail, as the claims of the apostolic See are
beyond computation.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In the Act of Resumption of 1 Henry VII., the King
excludes the lands of his wife, his mother, Cecile,
Duchess of York, and others. And in the Act of
Restitution of Margaret, Countess of Richmond, “she
was to hold her lands as any other sole person, not wife,
may do,” though she was married at the time to the Earl
of Derby.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Had the Cure of Churches.</b>—The Abbesses of certain
convents inherited the right of dominating the religious
succession in some churches (<i>see</i> “Dyer on Grendon’s
Case”), “divers churches were appropriated to prioresses
and nunneries, whereof women were the governesses”
(Callis, 250). In Colt and Glover <i>v.</i> Bishop of Coventry
and Lichfield about a presentation to a church, the
evidence shews that many women before the Reformation
had the Cure of Churches; that an Archbishop
could not legally appropriate a benefice with the Cure to
a nunnery between 25 H. 8., and the dissolution of
monasteries, though the Pope did.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Foulkes is the Lay-rector of Stanstey, and
takes the tithes. She pays one shilling a year as quit-rent
to the Lord of the Manor of Stanstey, County Denbigh”
(Blount’s “Tenures”).</p>

<p class='c008'>“That all appropriated churches shall have secular
vicars” (<i>see</i> “Statutes,” vol. ii., Henry IV., c. 13).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could be Peeresses in their own Right, and liable
to Summons to Parliament in Person.</b>—Sir Harris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Nicolas says, “The usual form of a writ of summons to
Parliament is common. There is one solitary instance,
however, of an express limitation of the dignity to heirs
male, <i>i.e.</i>, in the Barony of Vesci”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c023'><sup>[3]</sup></a> (“Historic Peerages
and Baronies by Writ”). In Lady Spenser’s case (M. 11,
Henry IV., f. 15) it was decided that it was clear law at
all times that a Dame might be “Peer de Realm and
entitled to all the privileges of such.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c023'><sup>[4]</sup></a> “All peers of the
realm are looked on as the King’s Hereditary Councillors”
(<i>see</i> Jacob’s “Law Dictionary”).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is strange that this unique exception should have occurred in
this barony, which had come through a woman, and had been held
by a woman. Yvo de Vesci came over with William the Conqueror,
and married Alda Tyson, daughter and heir of the Lord of Alnwick.
Their daughter Beatrix was sole heir, and married Eustace of
Knaresborough, their son taking his mother’s name of De
Vesci.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>See</i> also “Statutes,” vol. ii., p. 321. Noble ladies shall be
tried as peers of the realm are tried, when they are indicted of
treason or felony, 20 Henry VI.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The opinions of Peeresses as representing property,
were always considered in the councils of the King. In
the early Norman days they sat among “The Magnates
Regni” in right of their fees and communities. “In
the Constitutions of Clarendon, Henry II., we find that
‘Universe Persona Regni, qui de Rege tenent in
Capite’ were to attend the King’s Court and
Council.” (Report of the Lord’s Committee on the
Dignity of a Peer of the Realm.) The Abbesses,
especially those of Shaftesbury, Barking, Wilton and
St. Mary of Winchester, holding directly of the King,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>were summoned to Anglo-Norman Parliaments, as they
had been summoned to Anglo-Saxon Witenagemots.
Selden mentions their Summons of 5 Edward I. as being
extant in his time; their Summons, twenty-nine years
later, to the Parliament of 34 Edward I. is still extant,
written in the same manner and terms as those of the
other clergy. (Palgrave’s “Parliamentary Writs”; 34
Edward I.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Other Peeresses were summoned according to their inheritance,
which, we have seen, followed different lines
from what it does to-day, or <b>by proxy</b>. By an exemption,
intended as a privilege in these days of rough
travelling and dangers, a peeress was permitted “to
chuse and name her lawful proxy to appear for her <i>ad
colloquimn et tractatium coram rege</i> on her behalf.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Alicia de Bigod sent her two proxies to Parliament, 35
Edward I. (<i>See</i> Rot. Parl., 189.) Selden and Gurden
mention “<i>nine</i> peeresses so summoned to the Parliament
of 35 Edward III.” There were in reality ten.
But there was not a <i>Parliament proper</i> that year, no
writs having been issued for the Commons. It was
rather a council of Peers and Peeresses, especially of
those holding lands in Ireland, who were summoned to
consult with the King what should be done in that
country, and what aid they would grant the King.
“Anno 35 Edward III., null summoniciones but summons
to council 11 Comitissæ summonitæ at mittend.
sede dagnos ad. colloq.” (Harl. MS., 6204).</p>

<p class='c008'>“De consilio summonite pro Terras habentibus in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Hibernia 35 Edward III., Maria Comitissa Norfolk,
Elianora Comitissa Ormond, Anna le Despencer, Pha.
Comitissa de la Marche, Johanna Fitz Walter, Agnes
Comitissa Pembroch, Maria de Sco Paulo Comitissa
Pembroch, Margeria de Ros, Matilda Comitissa Oxon,
Katherina, Com. Atholl, Nulla summonitii Parliamenti”
(Harl., 778). Dugdale gives the same names (“Summons
to Parliament,” p. 263) as summoned by their
faith and allegiance to send a deputy to consult with the
King and his council at Westminster. “Consimiliæ
Brevia diriguntur subscriptis, sub eadam Data, de

viz., Ad Quindenam Paschæ Mariæ Comitissa Norfolciæ,
Alianora Comitissa de Ormond, Annæ le Despenser, Ad

Mariæ de S. Paulo Comitissa Pembroc.,
Margeria de Roos, Matildæ Comitissæ Oxon, Katarinæ
Comitissæ Atholl,” 35 Edward III., claus in dorso m. 36.
These because they had property in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The proxies,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c023'><sup>[5]</sup></a> however, do not imply that the ladies
themselves would not have been admitted had they
chosen to appear, as the special summons of Margaret,
Countess Marshall, in 1 Richard II., clearly proves.
Men also were allowed to send proxies. “The Bishop
of Bath and Wells being infirm and old is allowed to
send a proxy to Parliament.” “Ralph Botiller Miles, Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of Sudeley, has the same permission” (6 Rot. Parl., app.,
ex Rot. Parl., 1 Edward IV., p. 1, m. [19] 227, a. b.).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plowden notes on this, that the privilege of voting by proxy is
a privilege of the House of Lords. (“Jura Anglorum,” p. 384.)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The husband’s succession to his wife’s titles was in
order to grant her a permanent and interested “proxy.”
In Dugdale’s “Summons to Parliament,” p. 576, there
is “A catalogue of such noble persons as have had their
summons to Parliament in right of their wives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This proves:—</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) That a man not entitled to be summoned in his
own right could be summoned in his wife’s right, but
that in doing so he must take her name and title,
whether higher or lower than his own: “George, son
and heir to Thomas Stanley, Earl of Derby, having
married Joane, the daughter and heir to John, Lord
Strange of Knockin, had summons to the Parliament
under the title of Lord Strange” (22 Edward IV.,
1 Richard III., 3, 11, 12 Henry VII.).</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) That a woman held her husband’s titles and
possessions till her death by “the courtesy of England,”
and could even transfer these while she was alive to
another husband. “Ralphe de Monthermer, having
married Joane of Acre, daughter of King Edward I. and
widow of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
possessing lands of great extent in her right, which
belonged to these earldoms, had summons to Parliament
from 28 Edward I. to 35 Edward I. by the title of Earl
of Gloucester and Hertford. But after her death, which
happened in the first year of King Edward the Second,
he never had the title of Earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and was summoned to Parliament as a Baron only
from the second to the eighteenth of that King’s reign”
(Dugdale’s “Summons to Parliament”). There are
twenty other cases of nobles summoned in the name of
their wives. This, therefore, may be taken to illustrate
the representative power in Peers. At the period of Ela
of Salisbury the heiress of the Albemarles had conferred
her title on three husbands, by the second of whom,
William de Fortibus, she had an heir.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isobel of Gloucester likewise had two Earls” (Bowle’s
“History of Lacock Abbey”).</p>

<p class='c008'>Margaret de Newburgh, Countess of Warwick, married
John Marshall of the Pembroke family, and he became
Earl of Warwick, <i>Jure Uxoris</i>. She re-married John de
Plessetis, who also bore her title. Her cousin, William
Mauduit, succeeded her, and then Isabel, his sister, who
married William de Beauchamp, making him Earl of Warwick.
Their daughter, Anne de Beauchamp, succeeded
as Countess of Warwick. (Burke’s “Extinct Peerages.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Dugdale also mentions “the names of such noble
persons whose titles are either the names of such heirs
female, from whom they be descended, or the names of
such places whence these heirs female assumed their
titles of dignity: of whose summons to Parliament by
these titles the general index will show the respective
times.” There are twenty-eight of them. The eldest
sons of earls were sometimes summoned to Parliament
by their father’s second title in their father’s lifetime, and
these titles were often inherited from an ancestress.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>That the right of Peeresses to be consulted in relation
to aids or subsidies assessed on their property, was acknowledged,
can be learned from an interesting document
still preserved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Commons in 1404 voted a grant to the King (Rot.
Parl., iii., 546). “La grante faite au Roy en Parlement.
Vos pauvres Commons ... par assent des Seigneurs
Spirituelx et Temporels ... grauntont à vous, en cest
present parlement deux Quinzismes et deux Dismes
pour estre levez des laie gentz, en manere accustume ...
Et les Seigneurs Temporelx pur eux, et les <i>Dames Temporelx</i>,

soit pris en ensample de charger les ditz Seigneurs et
Communes de Roialme ... sil ne soit par les voluntées
des Seigneurs et Communes de vostre Roiaume et ces de
nouvell graunt a faire en plein Parlement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This, therefore, affirmed not only the rights of the
Ladies Temporal to be considered at the time, but the
grand principle of <i>non tallagio, non concedendo</i>, to all time
for all classes.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>The</span> Statutory history of Individual Privilege is not clear
in very early times, before the Norman Customs and
Saxon Laws coalesced. Magna Charta was wrested from
John in 1215, and confirmed by succeeding monarchs.
It is written in Latin, and the word Homo is applied
throughout to both sexes. When it is intended to distinguish
males from females other words are used. The
most important clause in that Charter is, “To none will
we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we delay the
right of Justice.” There were then no doubts in the
mind of the people, no quibblings in the courts of law as
to whether or not it extended to women. All early laws
are couched in general terms, however they may have
suffered from later legal and illegal glosses. Coke upon
Littleton, Inst. II., 14, 17, 29, and 45, explains that
“Counts and Barons” represent all other titles, whether
held by men or women; that Liber Homo meant <i>freeman</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><i>and freewoman</i>. “Nullus liber homo. Albeit <i>homo</i>
doth extend to both sexes, men and women, yet by Act
of Parliament it is enacted and declared that this chapter
should extend to Duchesses, Countesses, and Baronesses.
Marchionesses and Viscountesses are omitted, but, notwithstanding,
they are also comprehended within this
chapter.”</p>
<p class='c008'><b>County women inherited freeholds</b> under the same
conditions as Noblewomen.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an heiress married a man of an inferior family or a
smaller property, she could, if she chose, raise him to
her rank, and make him take her name. Thomas de
Littleton, upon whose Digest of English laws Coke
exercised his talents, received arms, name, and estate
from his mother, “who, being of a noble spirit, <i>whilst it
was in her power</i>, provided, by Westcote’s assent, that
her children should bear her name.” In other words,
the heiress of the Littletons married Westcote, but while
she was yet a freewoman imposed conditions. (<i>See</i>
“Life of Littleton” prefixed to his works.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>When married could act as femes soles.</b>—Among
“ancient deeds and charters, drawn up by landowners
in the time of Edward III. and Richard II.”
(Harl. MS. 6187), there are many executed by women,
many sealed by women alone, their husbands being
alive, many sealed by women along with their husbands.</p>

<p class='c008'>A grant by William Faber de St. Briarville and Sarra
his wife is sealed by the name of Sarra Hathwey alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and another deed by her son is signed by William Faber,
son and heir of Sarra Hathwey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Robert de la Walter de Staunton and his wife Marjory
combine in a deed, and both seals affixed. So Thomas
Waryn and his wife Julia, daughter of Thomas Baroun,
Richard de Pulton and Agnes his wife, and others.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They owed also military service</b> either to their Overlord
or to the King directly. We find this abundantly
illustrated in Palgrave’s “Parliamentary Writs,” and in
any of the Domestic Series of State Papers in the Public
Record Office recording service assessed. All names are
used in common. For instance, “Names of <i>gentlemen</i>
furnishing light horses and lances, 1583: Bramber,
Dorothy Lewknor, 2; Pevensey, Elizabeth Pankhurst, 1,
etc.; Domina Gage, 2;<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c023'><sup>[6]</sup></a> John Gage, 2; Elizabeth
Geoffrey, 1” (Harl. MS., 703, f. 87).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These were “the two Gages” mentioned in connection with the
Copleys of Gatton.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>There are many women returned in the “Rotuli Hundredorum,”
Ed. I., as holding under military tenures in
capite. “Eve de Stopham held her estate by finding for
the King one footman, a bow without a string, and an arrow
without feathers” (Blount’s “Tenures”). “Lady Custance
de Pukelereston holds Pukelereston by finding one
man and a horse, with a sack and an axe, at the summons
of the King” (“Testa de Nevill,” 252). The Manor of
Gatton, known as the scene of contested elections in
after years, was held by the service of a knight’s fee and
the payment of Castle guard to Dover Castle.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The “Testa de Nevill” compiled in the reign of Henry
III. and Edward I., gives the list of many holding in
capite and of Overlords by military service.[<a href='#app-iii'>iii</a>.]</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They also paid and received Homage.</b>—In the Harl. MS.
(6187) many of the tenements are conveyed by women,
on condition of Homage rendered and service given;
as, for instance, in the cases of Sibilla de Bruneshope,
widow; Johanna de Muchgross, daughter of Willian de
Muchgross; Agnes de Bellecores; Agnes, daughter and
heir of Henry de Munsterworth; Cecilia Blundell de
Teynton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the Records of Banham Marshall, Beckhall
and Greyes, there is one transferring lands to a certain
Dorothy Gawdy, 31st March, 1659. “At a court held
by the Homage”—“to which said Dorothy here in full
courte is delivered thereof seisin. To hold to her and
to her heires by A Rodd att the will of the Lords, according
to the custom of this Manor, by the rents and
services therefore due and of right accustomed and she
giveth to the Lords a fine. Her fealty is respited for a
certain time.” Five days later this Lady died, and a
new transfer was made to her heirs male in same form.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could present to Churches.</b>—In 16 Edward II.
Eleanor, wife of Thomas Multon of Egremond, petitions

<p class='c008'>Women combined with men to elect Knights of the
Shire to defend in Parliament the rights of their property
and themselves from unequal assessment of subsidy and
undue exactions of the King.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Sir Walter Raleigh’s treatise on the Prerogative of
Parliaments, he traces back the origin of the House of
Commons to 18 Henry I. on rather slender bases. At
the time of the struggle with John it was clearly perceived
that irresponsible kings could not be trusted to observe
all the clauses of Magna Charta, and general councils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>were provided for. John promised to summon <i>all classes</i>
to consult with him when it was necessary to assess aids
and scutage. But John’s word was not worth much.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first <i>clear</i> Summons appears to be that of 38
Henry III. (1254), when a Writ was issued requiring the
Sheriff of each County to “cause to come before the
King’s Council two good and discreet Knights of the
Shire, whom the <i>men</i> of the County shall have chosen for
this purpose in the stead of all and of each of them, to
consider, along with Knights of other Shires, what aid
they will grant the King.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In 49 Henry III. (1265), writs were issued for “two
Knights of the Shire to be chosen by <i>the annual suitors
at the County Courts</i>,” and two Citizens from each Borough.
Their expenses were to be paid by those who sent them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Statute passed in the Parliament of Marlebridge
(52 Henry III.) by members elected in this manner,
more clearly defined this method of election, and confirmed
the more ancient Statutes regarding <i>the County
Courts</i>. Hallam and Lewis trace their origin to the Anglo-Saxon
Shiregemote, Folkmote, or Revemote, and prove
that the Sheriffs and dignitaries possessed only directory
and regulative powers; that the Freeholders, who were
obliged to do “suit and service,” were the Pares or
Judges, as well as the Electors of the Knights of the Shire,
and of the Sheriffs themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Concerning this court, it had been provided (43
Henry III.), “that Archbishops, Bishops, Earls,
Barons, or any religious Men or Women, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>not be forced to come thither unless their presence
was especially required.” Their goods could not be
distrained for non-attendance. That this was intended
as a Franchise of Privilege, not inducing a penalty of exclusion,
is perfectly clear, not only in the reading of the
Act itself, but in its effect upon later laws.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Coke, (Inst. II., 119,) elucidating the laws of Marlebridge,
made three years later, says, “Note. A woman
may be a free Suitor to the Courts of the Lord, but
though it be generally said that the free suitors be Judges
in these courts, it is <i>intended of men and not of women</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This “priestly intention” sprang only from Coke’s own
mind. He cites no authority for his opinion, nor could
he have found one. To have deprived a female “Suitor”
of her right to express her opinion and thereby help to
determine the questions brought before the Court, in
the light of her own interests, inclinations, or opinions,
would have taken away her prime <i>raison d’être</i>. Her
second privilege was that of giving her voice, with other
freeholders, towards the election of a knight, “in the
stead of all and of each of them,” to go to the King’s
parliament,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c023'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and defend her interests there. Upon the
petition of the Commons that proclamation should be
made of the day and place of the meeting of the County
Court, it was decreed, “All they that be there present,
as well <i>suitors</i> duly summoned, as <i>others</i>, shall attend to
the election of the Knights of Parliament.... And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>after they be chosen, the names of the persons so chosen
shall be written in an <i>Indenture</i>,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c023'><sup>[8]</sup></a> under the <i>seales</i> of all
them that did chuse them, and tacked to the said writ
of Parliament” (7 Henry IV., c. xiii.). A certain
limitation, therefore, of electors, must have been caused
through the necessity of possessing seals. In 8 Henry
VI. the suitors at the County Court were limited
to those who had not less than a 40s. freehold. It was
soon made clear that the House of Commons was only
intended to represent those not eligible in person or in
representation to the Upper House; so that the county
elections became limited to county freeholders below the
rank of Peers. But there is no question, at any time,
of altering the Franchise from the general terms to
others that would limit it to the masculine being. That
women did frequent the courts in person is proved in
Prynne’s “Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva” (p. 152, <i>et
seq.</i>), where he refers to “sundry Earls, Lords and Ladies
who were annual suitors to the County Courts of Yorkshire.”
That women recorded these votes, and sealed the
indentures of the Knights elected, is also proved by
Prynne. The two points that surprised Prynne were,
that the earliest preserved indentures were <i>all</i> signed by
the Nobility of the County, and by them alone, and also
that they were all sealed by attorney, by Lords, or by
Ladies alike, down to 7 Henry VI., after which they were
signed by all Freeholders personally. He does not seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>to remember that these were the classes privileged by
Act 43 Henry III., to absent themselves from the
County Courts; and that acting by proxy was considered
a privilege of the nobility. It might very well have been
considered that Archbishops, Earls, Lords, and Ladies
were “especially required” at the County Court to hear
and decide on some important territorial dispute, and yet
that they could decide on the merits of a candidate at
home, and send their Attorneys to the County Court to
seal for them there in the presence of the Sheriff. One
such indenture (2 Henry V.) is signed by Robert Barry,
the Attorney of Margaret, widow of Sir Henry Vavasour.
In another return from the County of York, one Attorney
signs for the Earl of Westmoreland, and another for the
Countess, for the lands each held as freeholds in that
neighbouring county.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have not found any example of a lady “Knight of
the Shire,” but neither have I found the shadow of a <i>law</i>
against their existence beyond that of the electors’ choice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>or the ladies’ convenience. Anne Clifford said that if
her candidate did not come forward “she would stand
herself.” (Dr. Smith to Williamson, Jan. 1668. Dom.
Ser. State Papers, Public Record Office.) But as women
summoned to do military service were <i>allowed</i> to send a
substitute, as women summoned to the County Courts
were <i>allowed</i> to absent themselves, and <i>allowed</i> to send
an Attorney, so were they allowed to send their knights
to the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c008'>If women of the Middle Ages had but realised what
their ancestresses did before them, “that they were receiving
what they must hand down to their children
neither tarnished nor depreciated, what future daughters-in-law
may receive, and may so pass on to their grandchildren”
(Tacitus Germ., c. viii.), the needs of litigation
on this point might not have arisen later.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Could Nominate to Private Boroughs.</b>—Certain
Boroughs formerly held by military tenure seemed to
have been included in those permitted to return burgesses
to Parliament, though belonging to one owner. When
women inherited the property and held the Borough, they
returned their one or two members, as the custom might
be, in their own name. “The members of many ancient
Boroughs were often returned by the Lords, and sometimes
by the Ladies of the Manors or Boroughs” (Plowden’s
“Jura Anglorum,” p. 438). Many cases are doubtless
lost among the piles of missing records. But two very
illustrative examples have been preserved for us, just
sufficient to clear away all doubts from the minds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>students of history that women sometimes exercised the
privileges they possessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a bundle of Returns for 14 and 18 Eliz., Brady has
preserved, and Heywood, in his “County Elections,” has
quoted, that of Dame Dorothy Packington, the owner of
the private Borough of Aylesbury. In days when military
service might have been demanded of her, she would
have sent her “substitute” to defend her sovereign; in
days when subsidy service was expected of her, she sent
a “substitute” to Parliament to defend her interests
there, and she paid for both her military and civil representatives.
“To all Christian people to whom this present
writing shall come, I, Dame Dorothy Packington, widow,
late wife of Sir John Packington, Knight, Lord and Owner
of the Town of Aylesbury, sendeth greeting. Know ye
me, the said Dame Dorothy Packington, to have shown,
named, and appointed my trusty and well-beloved
Thomas Lichfield and John Burden, Esquires, to be my
burgesses of my said town of Aylesbury. And whatsoever
the said Thomas and George, burgesses, shall do in
the service of the Queen’s highness in that present parliament
to be holden at Westminster the 8th day of May
next ensuing the date hereof, I, the same Dame Dorothy
Packington, do ratify and approve to be my own act, as
fully and wholly as if I were, or might be present myself.”
She signed their indentures, sealed them, paid “their
wages” and their expenses in whole, as others did in part.
That the return was held good is sufficient to prove its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>legality.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c023'><sup>[10]</sup></a> There is not the shadow of grounds for a
belief that she “acted as returning officer,” as some have
said who have not studied the case. Later on, when the
population of Aylesbury increased, and the ambitions of
Aylesbury extended, there was an appeal by the inhabitants
for permission to share in the Returns.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c023'><sup>[11]</sup></a> But the
objection to the monopoly of the Family-Return did not
include an objection to the woman that exercised it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another memorable instance is preserved for us in
the Journals of the House of Commons itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have found out so many curious, hitherto un-noted
details about it, that I thought it advisable
fully to illustrate the conditions of the case, so
that it may not again be mistranslated, as it has
so often been. On March 25th, 1628, there was a
contested election for the Borough of Gatton. There
were <i>two</i> indentures returned, one by the inhabitants of
the borough, and the other by Mr. Copley. Though he
returned Sir Thomas Lake, and Mr. Jerome Weston, “it
was held not good that he should have returned alone.”
The case was argued out before the Committee of
privileges in the House of Commons, of which Glanvil,
Hakewell, and Sir Edward Coke were members. Mr.
Copley based his claim on returns made by Roger
Copley, as the <i>sole inhabitant</i> in 33 Henry VIII.; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>by Mr. Copley in 1 and 2 Phil. and Mary, 2 and 3 Phil.
and Mary. “On the other part, in 7 Edward VI., Mrs.
Copley et omnes inhabitantes returned. In 28º, 43º
Eliz. 1º, 18º Jac., the return was made by the inhabitants,
and in all later parliaments Mr. Copley joined with the
other inhabitants.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Committee and the other members of the House
decided that “Mrs. Copley and the other inhabitants”
was the true and legal Precedent for the form of Return.
And that is the last word Parliament has had to say
upon a Woman-Elector. (<i>See Commons Journal</i> of date.)
But the side-lights of the story are interesting. In the
first place, the <i>Commons Journal</i> has a misprint of an
“s” in two cases. Roger Copley died in 1550-1; and
from the manuscript copies of the <i>Commons Journal</i> we
may see that <i>Mrs.</i> Copley is entered as returning alone
in 1 and 2 Philip and Mary, and 2 and 3 Philip and
Mary. (<i>See</i> Lansdowne MS., 545.) Further, both the
printed and the MS. copy are wrong about her title, as
she was the Lady Elizabeth Copley, or “Elizabeth Copley
Domina de Gatton.” This mistake shows that her own
<i>seal</i> was affixed to the indenture with her Christian name,
to which the Committee added “Mrs.” instead of
“Lady.” Further, she must also have returned in 4 and
5 Philip and Mary, and must have returned her son.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c023'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
On the 5th March young Copley of Gatton was committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to the sergeant for irreverent words spoken of
Her Majesty, and on 7th March Parliament was prorogued
till 5th November. (<i>Commons Journal.</i>) This
receives further explanation in additional MS. 24, 278,
collected by Sir Richard St. George Norroy:—“Sat., 5th
March, 4 and 5 Philip and Mary. For that Mr. Copley,
a member of this house, hath spoken irreverent words of
the Queenes Majestie, concerning the Bill for confirmacion
of pattents, saying that he feared the Queene might
thereby give away the Crowne from the right inheritor,
the house commanded, by Mr. Speaker, that Copley
should absent himself until consultation more had thereof.
And after consultation had and agreed to be a
grievous fault, Copley was called in and required this
House to consider his youth, and that if it be an offence
it might be imputed to his young yeares. The House
referred the offence by the Speaker to the Queene with a
plea for mercy, and Mr. Copley committed to the custody
of the Sergeant-at-arms. Monday, 7th March, Mr.
Speaker declared that he had declared to the Queenes
Majestie the matter touching Copley, wherein hir pleasure
was that he should be examined whereof fresh
matter did spring. Nevertheless, Her Majestie would
well consider the request of the House in his favour.
In the afternoon Parliament prorogued” (<i>Commons
Journal</i>). “Elizabeth, the second wife and widow of
Sir Roger Copley, daughter of Sir William Shelley,
Justice of the Common Pleas, presented to the Church
of Gatton in 1552, as did her son Thomas in 1562; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>after that time, the family, being Roman Catholics, it was
vested in trustees, 1571” (Manning and Bray’s “Surrey”).
The troubles of the Copleys and Gatton arose from
<i>recusancy</i>, not women’s elections. Elizabeth died in
1560, “seized of Gatton,” held of the Queen in fealty
for 1d. rent, and 20s. castleguard to Dover Castle. (<i>See</i>
“Inquisition <i>Post-Mortem</i>,” 29 April, 2 Eliz.) It must,
therefore, have been settled on herself. The daughter
of Sir William Shelley would surely be well advised of
her legal rights, and, perhaps, her association of the other
inhabitants with herself in her election of 7 Edward
VI., arose from an appreciation of the tendency of popular
opinion in favour of an inhabitant suffrage, instead of
a freeholding one.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Harl. MS., 703, Burghley writes to the Sheriff of
Surrey:—“Whereas there are to be returned by you
against the Parliament two Burgesses for Gatton in that
Countie of Surrey, which, <i>heretofore</i>, have been <i>nominated
by Mr. Coplie</i>, for that there are no Burgesses in
the Borough there to nominate them, for as much as by
the death of the said Mr. Copley and minoritie of his
sonne, the same which his lands are within the survey
and rule of the Court of Wards, whereof I am her
Majestie’s chiefe officer, you shall, therefore, forbeare to
make returne of anie for the saide towne, without direction
first had from me therein, whereof I praie you not
to faile” (St. James, 13th Nov., 1584). Sir Thomas
died abroad, 1584, aged 49, leaving William, his son
and heir. Apparently Francis Bacon and Thomas Busshop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>had been nominated by Burghley; because the
next letter preserved, dated 24th Nov., 1584, tells
the Sheriff to appoint Edward Browne, Esq., in the
place of Bacon, who had been returned for another
borough. In 11th Sept., 1586, Walsingham instructs the
Sheriff of Sussex to send up Mrs. Copley of Rossey to
the charge of the Warden of the Fleet, and the two
Gages, and they are to have no conference. Jan. 29th,
1595, Buckhurst writes to Sir Walter Covert and Harry
Shelley, Esq., to apprehend “the Lady Copley and certaine
other daungerous persons remayning with her as it
is enformed, where very dangerous practizes are in
hande” (Harl. 703, f. 87).</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Queen, by reason of —— Copley, Esq,
going
beyond sea and not returning according to Parliament,
presented Ralph Rand, M.A., to the Church of Gatton,
8th Feb., 1598.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On 7th Feb., 1620, the House considered the
return of Gatton in Surrey. One Smith, a burgess
for that town, and a son of Mr. Copley appeared.
Mr. Copley, lord of the town, a recusant convict, with
six of his lessees, no freeholders, made their choice the
Tuesday before; the freeholders made their choice, on
the Wednesday, of Sir Thomas Gresham and Sir Thomas
Bludder. The first return held void. Sir Henry
Brittayne asked leave to speak; he said “the writ was
directed Burgensibus, and delivered to Mr. Copley. The
town was but of seven houses, all but one Copley’s
tenants. That the election by them good not being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>freeholders. That all the freeholders, except one, dwelt
out of the town, and only held of the manor in the
town.” “Sir Edward Coke spoke against Copley’s
return, and moved for a new election, <i>in case of danger
from Copley</i>” (<i>Commons Journal</i>). (<i>See</i> also Lansd. MS.,
545; Hakewell’s “Report of the Gatton Case.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>This, therefore, makes the controversy comprehensible
that, in 1628, was illustrated by the records.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. William Copley was not inclined tamely to resign
the ancient privilege of his family of sending up
Burgesses for their own Borough; he attempted to do so
again, in spite of the decision of 1620, and through the
adverse decision in his case, Parliament affirmed, and
Sir Edward Coke with it, the right of a woman to vote.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>In</span> days when the word “Free” had no doubtful signification,
women could be “Free” in several different ways.
They could be Freeholders in towns by inheritance or by
purchase. They could be Free of “Companies,” in some
of them by patrimony, service, or payment; in others
through being widows of Freemen only. In some cases
a widow’s “Freedom” was limited by the conditions of
her husband’s will, but in almost all of the Companies, at
least, in London, <i>some</i> women could be Free. They
could be Free in Boroughs, under the same conditions as
men, by paying brotherhood money, and by sharing in
the common duties of Burgesses, as “Watch and Ward,”
“Scot and Lot,” and the service of the King; they could
be “Free” as regards the Corporation, and they could be
“Free” as regards voting for members of Parliament.</p>
<p class='c008'>I have preferred to use the word “Freewomen” as
more definite than any other. The “Widows and
Spinsters” phrase of to-day does not carry back to old
history. Under certain limited conditions married
women could be “Free”; under certain other conditions
they could be “Spinsters.”</p>

as well as her privileges, can be imprisoned for

<p class='c008'>(<i>See</i> also “Historical Manuscripts Commission,”
vol. x., appendix iv., p. 466, <i>et. seq.</i> Report on
papers found in Town Hall, Chelmsford.) There,
among several lists of women, wives, and mothers,
are many designated “Spinsters.” Among “presentments
for neglecting to attend church” (23 Eliz.) were
ten women—“Margareta Tirrell, spinster, alias dicta
Margaretta Tirrell uxor Thomae Tirrell armigeri”:
“Maria Lady Petre, spinster, alias dicta Maria Domina
Petre uxor Johannis Petre de Westhornden prædicta
Milites.” Many others appear as “wife of” at the same
time as “spinster.” The writer of the Report believes
that “spinster” in these cases was equivalent to “generosa,”
and notes that it is insisted on when women have
married men of meaner descent. I myself am inclined
to think that a Guild of women had arisen out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>silk-spinning industries of Essex, and that the word
“Spinster” implied membership of that Guild.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Members of Guilds.</b>—In the old social and religious
guilds which seem to have been established for good
fellowship during life, for due burial, prayers and masses
after death, and for charitable assistance of needy survivors,
there was perfect equality between the sexes.
Brotherhood money is exacted from “the sustren” as
well as from the brethren. In 1388 (12 Richard II.) an
order was given that all Guilds and Brotherhoods should
give “returns of their foundation.” Women appear as
the Founders of some of these. The Guild of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, Kingston-upon-Hull, was founded by 10
men and 12 women (p. 155). The Guild of Corpus
Christi, Hull, founded in 1358, by 18 women and 25 men
(p. 160, “Early English Gilds,” J. Toulmin Smith).
The Guild of the Holy Cross, Stratford-on-Avon, had
half of its members women, as also the Guild of Our
Lady, in the Parish of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, whose
original manuscripts I have read. Even when the
guild was managed by priests, as in the Guild of Corpus
Christi, York, women were among the members. In St.
George’s Guild, Norwich, men were charged 6s. 8d. and
women only 3s. 4d. for brotherhood. These guilds had
“Livery” of their own in some cases. They had a beneficial
effect on society, moral good conduct being necessary
to membership, and a generous rivalry in self-improvement
a condition of distinction. They taught
an equal moral standard for both sexes. Hence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>treatment of vicious men and vicious women was the
same. (<i>See</i> “Liber Albus,” p. 179, 180, etc.)</p>

<p class='c008'>They also did many good works towards the public
weal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Guild of the Holy Cross in Birmingham, to which
belonged the well-disposed men and women of Birmingham
and the neighbouring towns, had Letters Patent in
1392. The Report of its Condition in the reign of Edward
VI. says, “It kept in good reparacions two great stone
Bridges and divers foule and dangerous wayes, the charge
whereof the town, of hitselfe ys not hable to manteign,
so that the lacke thereof will be a great noysaunce to the
Kinges Majesties subjects passing to and from the
marches of Wales, and an utter ruyne to the same towne,
being one of the largest and most profitable townes to
the Kinges Highness in all the Shyre” (Toulmin
Smith’s “English Gilds,” pp. 244-249).</p>

<p class='c008'>These might have weathered the storms of the Reformation
by giving up candles and masses, had not
Henry seized their revenues and revoked their foundations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Trades Guilds in early days were also semi-religious
in their character, and also admitted women as
sisters.</p>

<p class='c008'>William Herbert’s “History of the Twelve Great
Livery Companies” gives many details interesting to us.
All the Charters of the Drapers’ Company expressly admit
Sisters with full rights; the wearing of the Livery, the
power of taking apprentices, sitting at the election feasts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>making ordinances among themselves for better governance,
etc. (vol. i., p. 422). So also did the Clothworkers.</p>

<p class='c008'>So also the Brewers’ Company. In 5 Henry V. there
were 39 women on the Company’s Livery paying full
quarterage money. In 9 Henry V. there are entries in
the books, of the purchase of cloth for the clothing of the
Brethren and Sistern of the Fraternity of the Brewers’
Craft. So also the Fishmongers (p. 59), the Weavers,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c023'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
and other companies. “The office of Plumber of the
Bridge granted to the Widow Foster, 1595.” (Guildhall
Records.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The Clockmakers’ Company, though only founded in
1632, had female apprentices sanctioned by the company
so late as 1715, 1725, 1730, 1733, 1734, 1747.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the Memoranda of the Grocers’ Company,
1345, we may note “each member of the fraternity shall
bring his wife or his companion to the dinner.” “And
that all the wives that now are, and afterward shall
become married to any of our Fraternitie; they shall be
entered and esteemed as belonging to the Fraternitie <i>for
ever</i> to assist them and treat them as one of us, and after
the decease of her husband the widowe shall still come
to the said election dinner, and shall pay 40d. <i>if she be
able</i>. And if the said widow is married to some other,
who is not of our Fraternitie, she shall not come to the
said dinner so long as she be ‘couverte de Baroun,’ nor
ought any of us to meddle with her in anything, nor
interfere on account of the Fraternitie so long as she is
‘couverte de Baroun’” (<i>see</i> Mr. Kingdon’s translation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the Books of the Grocers’ Company, 1341-1463, printed
in 1886). On a second widowhood she might return to
the company. At a later date they did not seem to be so
severe. One widow, interesting to me on other literary
grounds, made her second and third husbands free of the
company through the rights she gained from her first.
Widows paid Brotherhood money, held Apprentices,
traded and received all benefits of the Guild.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Company of Stationers seems to have followed
similar customs. Many women carried on their husband’s
business, and received apprentices, as Widow Herforde,
Widow Alldee, Widow Vautrollier. (<i>See</i> Arber’s reprint
of “Stationer’s Registers” and Ames’ “Typographical
Antiquities.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the “Journal of the House of Commons,” vol. ii.,
p. 331, December 3rd, 1641, we find two entries,
“Ordered that the Committee for printing do meet to-morrow
at eight of the clock in the Inner Court of Wards,
and the printing of the Book of Queries is referred to
that Committee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ordered that Elizabeth Purslow, who, as this House is
informed, printed the pamphlet entitled ‘Certain Queries
of some Tender-Conscienced Christians,’ be summoned to
attend the Committee appointed to examine the business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In Timperley’s “Cyclopædia of Literary Typographical
Anecdote” we find: In 1711 died Thomas
James, a noted printer in London, according to Dunton,
“something the better known for being husband to that
She-State politician, Mrs. Eleanor James.” This extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>woman wrote two letters to printers, one to
Masters, and one to Journeymen, the first beginning, “I
have been in the element of printing above forty years,”
and ending, “I rest your sister, and soul’s well-wisher,
Eleanor James.” Her husband, Thomas James, left his
fine library to the use of the public, and the President
and Fellows of Sion College were indebted to Mrs. James
for giving them the preference. She also presented them
with her own portrait, with that of her husband, and his
grandfather, Thomas James, first librarian to Bodleian
Library. “Her son, George James, who died in 1735, was
City Printer. His widow carried on the business for some
time, when the office was conferred on Henry Kent.”
(Timperley; <i>see</i> also Reading’s “Catalogue of Sion College
Library.”)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Women could also have Guilds of their own.</b>—[<a href='#app-iv'>iv</a>.] In
3 and 4 Edward IV., there was a “Petition from the Silkewomen
and Throwsters of the Craft and occupation of
Silkework within the cite of London, which be, and have
been craftes of women within the same cite of tyme that
noo mynde renneth to the contrarie, nowe more than a
M” (<i>i.e.</i>, 1000 in number), praying protection against the
introduction of foreign manufactured silk goods. (Parliamentary
Rolls, 1463.) And various Acts for their protection
are passed, down to 19 Henry VII., c. xxi.</p>

<p class='c008'>There seems also to be somewhat of the nature of a
Guild among the Midwives of London, who had a certain
social standing and certain laws and conditions of office.
Many of the Royal Midwives received annuities. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>appears in Rot. Parl. XIII., Ed. IV., Vol. VI., p. 93.
Among the exclusions from the Act of Resumption we
find, “Provided alwey that this Act extend not, nor in
any wise be prejudiciall to Margery Cobbe, late the wyf
of John Cobbe being midwyf to our best-beloved wyfe
Elizabeth Queen of England, unto any graunte by us, by
owre Letters Patentes of £40 by year, during the Life of
the said Margery.” Even in early times, their male
rivals tried to limit the extent of their professional
activities. Among the Petitions to Parliament is one
from Physicians who pray that “no woman be allowed
to intermeddle with the practice of Physic.” I. Rot. Parl.,
158.<sup>a</sup></p>

<p class='c008'>The Rolls of the Hundreds make mention of women
among the great Wool Merchants of London, “Widows
of London who make great trade in Wool and other
things, such as Isabella Buckerell and others.” Vol. I.,
pp. 403-4.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They might be Free of the City of London.</b>—The freedom
of the city of London became vested in those that
paid Scot and Lot, as women did. The Jews were not
allowed to pay Scot and Lot, and were never “free of
the city.” “And the King willeth that they shall not, by
reason of their Merchandize, be put to Scot or Lot, or in
any taxes with the men of the cities or Boroughs where
they abide; for that they are taxable to the King as his
bondmen, and to none other but the King” (Statutes,
vol. i., page 221). “That all Freemen shall make contribution
unto taxes and taillage in the city” (Liber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Albus III., pt. i., 235). “For watch and ward. Let all
such make contribution as shall be hostelers and housekeepers
in each ward” (p. 102). “And deeds and indentures,
and other writings under seal may be received; and
cognizances and confessions of women as to the same recorded
before the Mayor and one Alderman” (p. 16).
“Where women in such cases (<i>i.e.</i>, of debts) are impleaded
and wage their law,” they make their law with men or
women at their will (p. 37).</p>

<p class='c008'>Waller <i>v.</i> Hanger. Moore’s Cases, 832. Pasch. 9, Jac. I.
Frances Hanger. “El plead que el fuit libera fœmina
de London, and plead le Charter” that “the Freemen of
London should pay no dues upon their wines.” These
points are important to remember in the light of a
petition presented by the widows of London (17 Richard
II.) to be freed from taxes and taillage made in the city
without authority of Parliament; praying the King to remember
that it had been granted them that no such tax
would be imposed; and asking him to see that this
present Parliament would prevent the Mayor and Sheriff
of London from levying on them this new imposition not
levied by Act of Parliament. (Rot. Parl., vol. iii., 325.)
The Mayor and Aldermen present a counter petition saying
that the tax was for restorations, and praying that the
present Parliament should ordain that the widows may be
contributors according to proportion of the aforesaid fine,
for their tenements and rents in the city and suburbs
according to right and reason, ancient custom and charters
of the city, that those who <i>per commune</i> have advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the restoration ought by right to be contributors in
cost, etc. (<i>Ibid.</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>That women were no indifferent and over-timid members
of the community, we may see in the petition of the
Mercers of London to the King against the oppressions
of Nicholas Brember, Grocer and Mayor of London,
1386, 10 Richard II.:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Also we have be comaunded ofttyme up owre
ligeance to unnedeful and unleweful loose doynges.
And also to withdrawe us be the same comandement
fro things nedeful and leeful, as was shewed when
a company of gode women, there men dorst nought,
travailled en barfote to owre lige Lorde to seeke grace of
hym for trewe men as they supposed, for thanne were
such proclamacions made that no man ne woman shold
approche owre lige Lorde for sechynge of grace, etc.”
(Rot. Parl., vol. iii., p. 225).</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could be Free in other Boroughs.</b>—The female
burgesses of Tamworth are recorded in Domesday Book
as having been free before the conquest, and as being
still free in later times. If they took it upon them to
trade as <i>femes soles</i>, they made themselves liable to all
the common burdens of the “mercheta,” over and above
their proper borough duties of watch and ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Ipswich Domesday Book gives more than one
instance of a woman having “hominal rights,” and as
being liable to the “hominal duties” corresponding
thereto. To any <i>feme sole</i> the Franchise and even the
Guild was open on the same terms as to the men of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>place. There was no essoign of female burgesses whereby
to decline attendance at the motes (30 Edward I.).</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst liberi homines, liberi homines tenentes, or
liberi homines sub regia, in every English shire, the
Domesday Book records the names of <i>Freewomen</i>. (<i>See</i>
Chisholm Anstey’s “Supposed Restraints.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>I have personally searched the records of Stratford-upon-Avon.
There women could be burgesses. One
entry, noted for another purpose, I may here quote: “At
a Hall holden in the Gildehall, 9th September, 1573, Adrian
Queeney and John Shakespeare being present, the
town council received of Christian White for her sisterhood,
6s. 8d.; Robert Wright for his brotherhood, 6s. 8d.”</p>

<p class='c008'>York. “Women being free of the city, on marrying a
man who is not free, forfeit their freedom. Persons
are entitled to become free by birth, by apprenticeship,
or by gift or grant. Every person who has served an
apprenticeship for seven years under a binding by indentures
for that period to a freeman or freewoman
inhabiting and carrying on trade in the city is entitled to
become free. The indentures may be assigned to
another master or mistress being free. The privileges of
freemen are extended to the partners of freemen and to
their widows.” (“Report of Municipal Corporation Committee,
1835,” p. 1741.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The customs of Doncaster seem somewhat similar.
(<i>See</i> same report, p. 1497.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The City of Chester followed the custom of London.
(<i>See</i> “The Mayor’s Book of Chester, 1597-8.”)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Letter from Lord Burleigh to the officers of the Port
of Chester, authorising them to enter without tax the
Gascony wines of a city merchant’s widow:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“After my hartie commendacions, Whereas I understand

<p class='c008'>In 1597, by the same books, some money was distributed
to twenty poor people, having been free of the
city twenty years at least; among these were five women.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Town of Winchester women could be free.
In an old Customary of that town we may find “Every
woman selling Bread in the High Street, not having the
freedom, pays to the King 2s. 5d. a year, and to the
City Clerk 1d., if she sells by the year, if less, in proportion.
Every woman who brews for sale is to make good
beer. No Brewer not free of the City (nul Brasceresse
hors de Franchise) can brew within the City jurisdiction
without compounding with the Bailiff.” (<i>Archæological
Journal</i>, vol. iv., 1852.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Hall-book of the corporation of Leicester 1621:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is agreed by a generall consent that Wm. Hartshorne,
husbandman, shall be made ffreeman of corporacon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>payinge such ffine as Mr. Maiour and the
Chambleyns that now be shall assess. But he is not
allowed any freedom or privilege by reason that his
mother was a ffreewoman. Neither is it thought fit that
any woman be hereafter made free of this corporacon.”
(<i>Notes and Queries</i>, vol. v., 5th series, p. 138.)</p>

<p class='c008'>This note is important as showing the period of the
change of tone and spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Women could be on the Corporation.</b>—In 1593, in the
Archives of the Borough of Maidstone, Kent, appears,
“That the 11th of September, 1593, Rose Cloke, single
woman, (according to the order and constitutions of the
town and parish of Maidstone aforesaid) was admitted to
be one of the corporation and body politique of the same
town and parish, from henceforth to enjoy the liberties
and franchises of the same in every respect, as others
the freemen of the said town and parish. And she was
also then sworn accordingly, and for some reasonable
causes and considerations then stated she was released
from paying any fine, other than for her said oath, which
she then paid accordingly” (<i>Notes and Queries</i>,
vol. xii., 5th series, 318). The transcriber doubts the
“legality” of Miss Rose Cloke’s election. But it was
not till a very long time after this date that any attempt
was made to interfere with the liberty of the electors in
choosing whom they would.</p>

<p class='c008'>Queen Elizabeth is said to have reproached the
women of Kent for not more fully exercising their
privileges. It may have been in connection with this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>illustration as to what their privileges might be. I had
long meditated on the inner meaning of this reproach,
before I came upon the elucidation. The freemen of
Kent alone, in England, rose in arms against William the
Conqueror, and would not lay them down until their
ancient laws and customs were confirmed to them. The
Custumal of Kent, therefore, based on the ancient Saxon
laws, gave wider privilege to women than the Normanised
laws of the rest of the country. Inheritance was
equal and independent of sex, either in relations of
descent or of marriage. The children all inherited
equally, with a certain special tender consideration for
the <i>youngest</i>, male or female. A widow had the half of
her husband’s property till she married again; a widower
had the half of his wife’s property, <i>while he remained
single</i>. This equality in property necessarily gave the
women of Kent fuller privilege. The recognition of the
freedom of womanhood naturally made the men of
Kent more free. “Of all the English shires, be ye surnamed
the Free.” (Drayton’s “Poly-Olbion, 18.”) [<a href='#app-v'>v</a>.]</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet some of the English shires did not lag far
behind Kent. We may note “A customary or note
of such customes as hath bin used, time out of
mind in Aston and Coat in ye parish of Bampton in
ye county of Oxon, and is att this time used and kept as
appeareth by ye <i>sixteens</i> who hath hereunto, with ye
consent of ye inhabitants of ye said Aston and Coat,
sett their hands and seals the sixt September, in ye 35th
yeare of Queen Elizabeth, Anno Dom. 1593.” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“customary” contains twelve articles regulating the
election and duties of the sixteens, of which the first is:
“The Custome is that upon our Lady-day Eve every
yeere, all the <i>Inhabitants</i> of Aston and Coat shall meet
at Aston Crosse about three of ye clock in ye afternoone,
or one of everye House to understand who shall serve
for ye sixteen for that year coming, and to choose other
officers for ye same yeere. (2) Ye said sixteens being
known, ye hundred tenants of ye same sixteens doe
divide themselves some distance from ye Lords Tenants
of ye said sixteens. And ye Hundreds Tenants do chuse
one grasse Steward and one Water Hayward, and the
Lords Tennants do choose two Grasse stewards and one
Water Hayward, etc. This antient custome have ben
confirmed in ye 35th yeare of Queen Elizabeth, 1593,
by most of ye substantiall inhabitants of Aston and Coat,

customs were formerly practised in Sussex, and may be
found in the Sussex Archæological Collections.”</p>
<p class='c008'>We find another case in “Grant’s Treatise of the Law
of Corporations,” p. 6.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In general women cannot be corporators, although
in some hospitals they may be so, and there is one
instance in the books of a Corporation consisting of
Brethren and Sisters and invested with municipal powers
to a certain extent, in The Pontenarii of Maidenhead
(vid Rep. 30). (Palmer’s “Cases,” p. 77, 17 Jac.,
B.R.) Quo Warranto vers Corporation de Maydenhead
in Berkshire, pur claymer de certaine Franchises
and Liberties, un Market, chescun Lundie, Pickage,
Stallage, Toll, etc.” (Rot. Cor. 106.) They pleaded
that the Bridge had been repaired by a Fraternitie, time
out of mind, which was dissolved, and that the King by
Letters Patent, on condition that they repaired the
Bridge, granted them a market every Monday with all
Liberties.... “Et le veritie fuit que Hen. 6 ad incorporate
un Corporation la per nomen Gardianorum
Fratrum et Sororum Pontenariorum, and concessit al eux
and leur Successors quod ipsi and Successores sui
haberent mercatum quolibet die lunae prout ante habuissent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>simul cum Tolneto, Pickagio, Stallagio, etc.” The
opinion of three Judges were “que Toll fuit bien grant
non obstant que le quantitie de Argent d’estre pay pur
Toll pur chescun chose ne fuit expresse, Mes Montague
Ch. Justice fuit cont. Mes que le Corporation enjoyera
les Privileges non obstant cest action port.” In page
626 of Grant’s Treatise, we see “A Corporation Sole is a
Body Politic having perpetual succession, and being constituted
in a single person.... Corporations Sole are
chiefly Ecclesiastical, one or two instances only of Lay
Corporations Sole occurring in the Books.... The most
important Corporation of this nature that claims attention
is the King.... It is as a Body Corporate that the
King is said to be immortal (Howell’s “State Trials,”
598).... A Queen Regnant is precisely and in the same
way and to all intents a Corporation, and, indeed, there
is nothing inconsistent with the principles of the old Law
in this; it was everyday’s experience before the Reformation
to find female subjects as Corporations Sole, as Lady
Abbesses, etc., but since that era it is superfluous to observe,
females cannot be invested with this description
of incorporation, though, as we have seen, they may be
Corporators of Hospitals, Railways, and other trading
bodies.” (Note. <i>See</i> “Abbess of Brinham’s Case.”
Yearbook, Ed. III., vol. xxiii.; 2 Rol. Abr. 348, l. 33;
and Colt <i>v.</i> Bishop of Coventry, Hob. 148, 149.)</p>

<p class='c008'><b>They could vote for Members of Parliament.</b>—To
their Municipal Rights were added, in the reign of Henry
III., their Parliamentary Rights.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>In 25 Edward II., De tallagio non concedendo, “It
was there declared that no tallage or aid shall be levied
by us, or by our heirs in the realm, without the goodwill
and assent of ... Knights, Burgesses, and other Freemen
of the Land.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As women were Burgesses and Liberi Homines, the
right was <i>given</i> to them as well as to men. Plowden
(“Jura Anglorum,” p. 438) remarks that “the Knights of
the Shire represented landed property, the Burgesses the
interests of manufacture or trade”; as women could be
Traders they were recognised as having the rights of
Traders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The qualifications of Electors in Boroughs were very
far from uniform or certain, as may have been noted in
the Gatton case.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Bath the Franchise was limited to the Mayor and Corporation.
Sometimes it was limited to freeholders, sometimes
to freeholders resident, at other times to inhabitants,
in other cases to inhabitants paying Scot and Lot.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London the Franchise was exercised by all paying
Scot or Lot.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Newcastle-on-Tyne, the Parliamentary Franchise
devolved on a Freeman’s widow, who could also carry
on his business. (Brand’s “History and Antiquities of
Newcastle,” vol. ii., p. 367.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The ordinances of Worcester (6 Edward IV., 49)—“Also
that every eleccion of citizens for to come to
the Parliament, that they be chosen openly in the gelde
Halle of such as ben dwellynge within the fraunches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and by the moste voice, accordinge to the lawe and to the
statutes in such cases ordayned and not privily”
(“Early English Gilds,” J. Toulmin Smith).</p>

<p class='c008'>In Shrewsbury, prior to the Reform Act, the right of
returning members of Parliament for the Borough was
vested exclusively in <i>Burgesses</i> paying Scot and Lot.
(“Mun. Com.,” p. 2014.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Rhuddlan—“Here, as in the other contributory
boroughs to Flint, the franchise is exercised by all resident
inhabitants paying Scot and Lot.” (“Mun. Com.,” p. 2840.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Reports of Controverted Elections, Luders
mentions that of Lyme Regis, 1789. The dispute was
whether non-resident burgesses could record their vote.
Among the old burgess lists brought forward to elucidate
the qualifications for electors, that of 29 Sept., 19 Eliz.,
was produced. The first three names on the list were of
three women—“Burgenses sive liberi tenentes Elizabetha
filiæ Thomæ Hyatt, Crispina Bowden Vidua, Alicia
Toller Vidua,” then follow the names of several men.
To these were added in 21 Eliz. two names of “liberi
burgenses jure uxoris.” Later records show an increased
number of women’s names on the register of this borough.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case of Holt <i>v.</i> Lyle or Coats <i>v.</i> Lisle in 14 James I.,
in discussing the right of a clergyman to vote, affirms
as a side issue that “a <i>feme sole</i>, if she have a freehold,
can vote for a Parliament man, but if she is married, her
husband must vote for her.” A limitation again expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in Catherine <i>v.</i> Surrey, preserved in Hakewell’s
“Manuscript Cases.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As some have attempted to throw doubts on the
authenticity of these cases, quoted as they were by the
Lord Chief-Justice from the Bench in 1739, it may be
well to note here that “William Hakewell was a great
student of legal antiquities, and a Master of Precedents”
(“Dictionary of National Biography”). He left parliamentary
life in 1629, the year after he had, in the Committee
of Parliamentary Privileges, helped to decide on
the Gatton case. He was one of the six lawyers appointed
to revise the Laws, and was thereafter created
Master of Chancery. So one might be tempted to consider
him rather an exceptionally good and trustworthy witness.
He helped to decide other points in connection with the
Franchise, which it is important for us to remember.
He not only decided that inhabitant suffrage must supersede
freeholding, that taxation gave the right to representation,
but that, from its very nature, no desuetude
could take away the right of voting. “On 9th April,
1614, it was pleaded, Sithence Durham last drawn in to
charge to join in petition to the King that Durham may
have writs for Knights and Burgesses. Said to be dumb
men because no voices. Mr. Ashley said, They of Durham
had held it a privilege not to be bound to attendance to
Parliament. On 31st May was read An Act for Knights
and Burgesses to have places in Parliament, for the
County Palatine, City of Durham and the Borough of
Castle Barnard.” “On 14th March, 1620, members were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>allowed for the Palatinate of Durham, which had hitherto
sat free from taxation, and consequently sent no members
to the House of Commons. It was allowed without
discussion by the House,” taxation and representation
being constitutionally inseparable. (<i>See</i> <i>Commons
Journal</i>, 14th March, 1620.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Regarding towns that had discontinued long sending
of any burgesses, and yet were allowed.” Hakewell
had discovered this of “Millborne Port, County Somerset,
and Webly, County Hereford, that, either from
poverty or ignorance of their right, or neglect of the
Sheriff, had ceased voting. After 321 years they elected
again.” “In 21 Jac. I. also, Amersham, Wendover,
Great Marlowe, in Buckinghamshire, were in the same
condition, but received writs for return upon application.”
(<i>See</i> Addit. MS., Brit. Mus. 8980.) Thus the
doctrine that the right to the Franchise never lapses, and
that <i>non-user</i> never deprives an Elector of this privilege,
was affirmed by the Committee of Privileges in the Parliament
of which Coke and Hakewell were members.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>The Errors of Sir Edward Coke.</b>—In a historical
treatise it is not necessary fully to analyse causes.
Facts must be left to speak for themselves. It
is a patent fact that, early in the seventeenth century,
men’s views regarding women became much altered, and
the liberties of women thereby curtailed. But there is
generally one voice that in expressing seems to lead the
opinion of an age. The accepted voice of this period,
on this subject, was not that of the “learned Selden” [<a href='#app-vi'>vi</a>.],
but of the “legal Coke.” He first pronounced an opinion
on the disability of women, and, as every other <i>so-called
authority</i> depends upon his, it is necessary to examine
the grounds of his opinion first, as with him all his
followers must stand or fall.</p>
<p class='c008'>When he was speaking against the Procuratores Cleri
having a voice in Parliament, it was urged on him that it
was unjust that persons should have to be bound by laws
which they had had no voice in making. To this he
replied, “In many cases multitudes are bound by Acts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Parliament which are not parties to the elections of
knights, citizens or burgesses, as all they that have no
freehold, or have freehold in ancient demesne; and <i>all
women having freehold or no freehold</i>, and men within the
age of one and twenty years” (“Fourth Institute,” 5). He
quotes no record, he suggests no authority, he adduces
no precedent. He could not. Yet from this one <i>obiter
dictum</i> of his, uttered in the heat of his discussion against
clergymen, recorded in loose notes, and published without
correction after his death, has arisen all consequent
opinion, custom and <i>law</i> against the Woman’s Franchise.
So terrible can be the consequences of the by-utterances
of a Judge when <i>careless, prejudiced, or wilfully ignorant</i>.
That Coke could be all three it is easy to prove.</p>

<p class='c008'>(1) In Prynne’s “Introduction to the Animadversions on
the Fourth Part of the Lawe of England,” he says, “My ardent
desires and studious endeavours to benefit the present
age and posterity to my power by advancing learning ... by
discovering sundry misquotations, mistakes of records
in our printed law books reports, especially in the Institute
of that eminent pillar of the Common Law, Sir Edward
Coke, published, with some disadvantage to him and his
readers since his death, whose quotations (through too
much credulity and supineness) are generally received,
relied on, by a mere implicit faith, as infallible Oracles,
without the least examination of their originals.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Male credulity in regard to Coke has been the cause of
so much direct and indirect suffering to women that it is
not surprising that they now attempt to get behind “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Oracle,” and question the Spirit itself of the English
Constitution. Many other writers besides Prynne refer
to Coke’s want of care. “In 1615 the King told him
to take into consideration and review his Book of
Reports; wherein, as His Majesty is informed, be many
extravagant and exorbitant opinions set down and published
for positive and good law.” (Chalmers’ Biog. Dict.)
“The Institutes published in his lifetime were very
incorrect. The 4th part not being published till after
his death, there are many and greater inaccuracies in it.”
One example in the contested passage may be noted.
He says that those who had no freehold had no vote.
He did not die until 1634, and the notes for the
“Fourth Institute” were the last work of his life. But
Granville’s “Reports” prove that by the Parliaments
of 1621 and 1628 the Franchise was declared to be
vested in <i>inhabitant householders whether freeholders
or not</i>, so he was incorrect as to that statement at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>(2) That, through prejudice, he could be blinded to
Justice can be seen in that picture preserved by his
Biographers of his hounding Sir Walter Raleigh to his
death by virulent unjudicial denunciations; or in that
other when he and his followers made a riot with swords
and staves in seizing his daughter from the home in which
his wife (formerly Lady Hatton) had placed her. The
King’s Council severely reprimanded him for his illegal
action then. (<i>See</i> “The Letter of the Council to Sir
Thomas Lake regarding the Proceedings of Sir Edward
Coke at Oatlands,” “Camden Miscell.,” vol. v.)</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The petition of Sir Francis Michell to the House of
Commons, 23rd February, 1620, contains trenchant
criticisms on Coke’s conduct as partial and passionate.
Though they may be somewhat discounted by the
writer’s position, they must have had some basis of truth.
Michell said that when summoned before the Bar, Sir
Edward Coke prejudiced his cause by saying aloud,
“When I was Chief-Justice, I knew Sir Francis Michell;
he is a <i>tainted man</i>,” which saying discouraged his friends
from speaking on his behalf. He repeats elsewhere that
Coke was wont “to make invectives by the hourglass”;
and indeed adds many other more serious charges.
Michell was put out, as was the custom, when his case
was being discussed. In his absence, he was condemned
to go to the Tower, and on being re-admitted,
thought he was to be allowed to defend himself as was
the custom, and “asked leave to speak for himself, which
Sir Edward Coke <i>hastened to refuse</i>” (Sir Simon
d’Ewes’ Papers, Harl. MSS., 158, f. 224). “His rancour,
descending to Brutality was infamous” (Dict. Nat. Biog.).
Sir Francis Bacon writes to him, “As your pleadings were
wont to insult our misery and inveigh literally against the
person, so are you still careless in this point to praise or
dispraise upon slight grounds and that suddenly, so that
your reproofs or commendations are for the most part
neglected and contemned, when the censure of a Judge
coming slow but sure should be a brand to the guilty and
a crown to the virtuous.... You make the laws too
much lean to your opinion, whereby you show yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to be a legal tyrant” (Foss’s “Lives of the Judges”).
James I. is known to have called him “the fittest engine
for a tyrant ever was in England.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was an only son with seven sisters, which position
probably made him overvalue his own sex. His well-known
matrimonial disputes probably helped to increase
his prejudice against the other sex.</p>

<p class='c008'>(3) That he could be <i>wilfully ignorant</i> there is abundant
ground to believe. He married again five months after
his first wife’s death, without Banns or Licence, and to
escape Excommunication, he pleaded Ignorance of the
Law!! “Not only does he interpolate, but he is often
inaccurate; sometimes, as in Gage’s case, he gives a wrong
account of the decision, and still more often the authorities
he cites do not bear out his propositions of law.
This is a fault common to his Reports and his Institutes
alike, and it has had very serious consequences upon
English Law” (Dict. Nat. Biog.). Holt <i>v.</i> Lyle, and
Catherine <i>v.</i> Surrey had been decided when he was
Attorney-General. These affirmed that “a <i>feme sole</i>
could vote for a Parliament man.” The Gatton case
had been decided in a Parliament, and by a Committee
of which he was a member; and whether he
had concurred in it or not, he cannot but have been
aware that other members of Parliament, even in his day,
allowed the woman’s privilege.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others have accused him of suppressing and falsifying
legal documents. (<i>See</i> Chisholm Anstey’s “Supposed
Constitutional Restraints.”) Chief Justice Best from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the Bench said, “I am afraid that we should get rid of a
good deal of what is considered law in Westminster Hall
if what Lord Coke says <i>without authority</i> is not law.”
2 Bing, 296.</p>

<p class='c008'>One other case which afterwards told heavily upon
women we may note. “Coke artfully inserted in the marriage
settlement of his fourth son John, with the daughter
and heiress of Anthony Wheatley, a clause of reversion to
<i>his own heirs</i> to the exclusion of heirs female, which was
not discovered until 1671, when John having died, leaving
seven daughters, their mother’s paternal inheritance passed
away from them to their uncle Robert, Coke’s fifth son.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“His legal propositions may often be unsound in substance,
but in his mode of stating what he believes or
wishes to be law he often reaches the perfection of form”
(Dict. Nat. Biography). This “<i>form</i>” may be sufficient
to satisfy legal technicalities, but I think I have brought
forward enough to show that intelligent women have
reason to object to him as a “tainted” authority. [<a href='#app-vii'>vii</a>.]</p>

<p class='c008'>Coke tells us in his “Fourth Institute,” what properties
a Parliament man should have. “He should have three
properties of the elephant; first, that he hath no gall;
second, that he is inflexible and cannot bow; third,
that he is of a most ripe and perfect memory. First to
be without gall, that is without malice, rancour, heat and
envy.” We have shown that Coke was deficient in the
first quality prescribed by himself for just judgment.
His abject submission to the Archbishop after his Breach
of the Canon Law, shows that he could bow very low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to escape the consequences of his wrongdoing; his
groveling in the dust before James, when he had roused
the King to wrath, shows that he could do the same when
he thought he was right, “from which we may learn that
he was, as such men always are, as dejected and fawning
in adversity as he was insolent and overbearing in prosperity”
(Chalmers’ “Biography”). We must now prove
that he was deficient in the third quality also. His
memory was imperfect. He forgot one Statute when he
was criticising another; he forgot what he had written in
the “Second Institute,” when he was preparing his manuscript
for the Fourth. It is only by self-contradiction
that he can hold the opinion now under discussion.
From his own works we must judge him on this count
(Coke <i>v.</i> Coke). In the “Fourth Institute,” 5, he
classifies women with minors. In the “Second Institute,”
c. iii., 96, his authorised and corrected work,
he says on the contrary, “Seeing that a <i>feme sole</i> that
cannot perform knight’s service may serve by deputy, it
may be demanded wherefore an heir male being within the
age of twenty-one years may not likewise serve by deputy.
To this it is answered, that in cases of minoritie all is one
to both sexes, <i>viz.</i>, if the heire male be at the death of
the ancestor under the age of one and twenty years, or
the heire female under the age of fourteen, they can make
no deputy, but the Lord will have wardship. Therefore,
Littleton is here to be understood of a <i>feme sole</i>
of full age and seized of land, holden by knight’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>service,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c023'><sup>[15]</sup></a> either by purchase or descent.” One would have
thought this clear enough for a legal mind to follow.
Women do not, therefore, come into the same class as
minors in regard to their appointing deputies. But they
do come into the class of Electors. (“Second Institute,”
119.) “A woman may be a free suitor to the Courts of
the Lord, and though it be generally said that the free
Suitors be Judges [<a href='#app-viii'>viii</a>.] in these courts, this is intended
of men and not of women.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In discussing the “Parliament of Marlebridge” (52 Henry III.,
chap, vi., p. 3) he says: “Albeit the heir be not <i>primogenitus</i>,
but an heir female, or male lineal or collateral, yet everyone of them
be within the same mischief.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>We have already noted the illegal character of this
opinion; but we repeat it here intentionally. Coke does
not see that in avoiding one of the horns of a dilemma
he throws himself on the other. If “women could be
suitors,” and were “not intended to be judges” or pares,
the only other duty left them as suitors, would be “to
elect their knights of the shire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The study of the original statutes supports the freedom
of women as to both duties, as well as the fact of their
having exercised that freedom. In Howell’s “State
Trials,” 19 (Entinck <i>v.</i> Carrington, 6 George III.), there
is a question asked and answered, worthy of repetition
here—“Can the judges extrajudicially make a thing
law to bind the Kingdom by a declaration that such is
their opinion? I say no. It is a matter of impeachment
for any judge to affirm it. There must be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>antecedent principle or authority from whence this
opinion may be fairly collected, otherwise the opinion is
null, and nothing but ignorance can excuse the judge
that subscribed it.” That women had to submit then is
no reason that they should submit now, as the same case
explains—“It would be strange doctrine to assert that
all the people of this land were bound to acknowledge
that as universal law which a few had been afraid to
dispute.”</p>

<p class='c008'><b>A believer in Coke’s views</b> and methods of perpetuating
them was Sir Simon d’Ewes, High Sheriff of Suffolk.
At the elections of 1640, Oct. 19th and 22nd, Sir Roger
North and his Royalist friends had charged him with
partiality towards the Puritan candidates. He cleared
himself eagerly and then added, “It is true that by the
ignorance of some of the Clarkes at the other two tables,
the <b>oaths of some single women that were freeholders</b>
were taken without the knowledge of the said High
Sheriff, who as soone as he had notice thereof instantly
sent to forbidd the same, conceiving it a matter verie
unworthie of any gentleman, and most dishonorable in
such an election, to make use of their voices, <i>although in
law they might have been allowed</i>. Nor did the High
Sheriff allow of the said votes, upon his numbering of
the said Poll, but with the allowance and consent of the
said two Knights themselves, discount them and cast
them out” (Sir Simon d’Ewes’ Papers; Harl. MS., 158).
Thus in a second illustrative case, personal opinion and
prejudice were allowed to counteract law and privilege.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>And the law-abiding women yielded to what they were
told was law, and, being kept in ignorance, they knew
no better.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in the very next year women showed that they
took a strong interest in public affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In vol. ii., p. 1673, Parliamentary History, is preserved
the Petition to the Commons for Redress of
Grievances, Feb. 4th, 1641. On the last day of sitting
many women had been observed to crowd much about
the door of the Commons, and Sergeant-Major Skippon
applied to the House to know what to do with them,
they telling him that where there was one now there
would be 500 next day. The House bade him speak
them fair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next day they presented their petition (printed by
John Wright at King’s Head in Old Bailey).</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Honourable Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses
of the House of Commons assembled in Parliament,
the Humble Petition of the Gentlewomen, Tradesmen’s
Wives, and many others of the Female Sex, all
inhabitants of London and the Suburbs thereof, with the
lowest submission showing, etc.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They acknowledge the care of the House in the
affairs of State. They have cheerfully joined in petitions
which have been exhibited “in behalf of the purity of
religion and the liberty of our husband’s persons and
estates.” “We counting ourselves to have an interest
in the common privileges with them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It may be thought strange and unbeseeming to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>sex to show ourselves by way of petition to this Honourable
Assembly. But the matter being rightly considered
of ... it will be found a duty commanded and required.
(1) Because Christ hath purchased us at as dear a rate
as he hath done men, and therefore requireth like
obedience for the same mercy as men. (2) Because in
the free enjoying of Christ in His own laws, and a
flourishing estate of the Church and Commonwealth
consisteth the happiness of women as well as of men.
(3) Because women are sharers in the common calamities
that accompany both Church and Commonwealth, when
oppression is exercised over the Church or Kingdom
wherein they live; and unlimited power given to the
prelates to exercise authority over the consciences of
women as well as men: witness Newgate and Smithfield,
and other places of persecution, wherein women, as well
as men, have felt the smart of their fury,” etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The petition was presented by Mrs. Anne Stagg, a
gentlewoman and brewer’s wife, and many others with her
of like rank and quality. Mr. Pym came to the
Common’s door, addressed the women and told them
that their petition had been thankfully accepted and
would be carefully considered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Coke’s papers had been seized by the King at his
death in 1634, but on the 12th May, 1641, the House
of Commons ordered Coke’s heir to print them, and thus
his views on this point were perpetuated.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 13th February, 1620, Coke had committed the
House to extraordinary doctrine in another relation to women.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Among Mr. Lovell’s witnesses was a lady, Mrs. Newdigate,
“the House calling to have them called in. Sir
Edward Coke out of St. Barnard said, A woman ought
not to speak in the congregation. Examination hereof
committed to a committee” (<i>Commons Journal</i>). It is
strange that Sir Edward Coke should have gone so far
afield as St. Barnard when St. Paul might have come in
as conveniently. Had he read the gospels as carefully
as he had read St. Barnard, he would have seen that one
of the first two preachers of Christ was Anna the
prophetess, who spake of Him in the temple to all them
that looked for redemption in Jerusalem (Luke ii. 36),
and that it was through women that Christ sent the first
message to the Apostles and Disciples, that became the
watchword of early Christianity, “Christ is arisen”
(Matthew xxviii., Luke xxiv., John xx.). Coke’s precedent
on this point was reversed in his own century.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 17th November, 1666, “Some debate arising
whether Mrs. Bodville, mother of Mrs. Roberts, should
be admitted as witness, the matter being debated in the
House, the question being put whether Mrs. Bodville be
admitted, it was resolved in the affirmative, and Mrs.
Bodville, with several other witnesses was examined”
(<i>Commons Journal</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>His utterance on the Women’s Franchise has coloured
the minds of willing disciples until to-day. In Add. MS.
25, 271, Hakewell on impositions, says, “To make a man
judge in his own cause and especiallie ye mightie over ye
weake, and that in pointe of profitt to him that judgeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>were to leave a way open to oppression and bondage.”
So women proved. There is no doubt that Puritanism
on the one hand, and the frivolity of the fashions of the
Restoration on the other, tended to make women content
with their narrowed political privileges, and restricted
educational opportunities. Only among the Society of
Friends, commonly called Quakers, did women retain
their natural place. Though there were some brilliant
exceptions, the majority of women, by the procrustean
methods of treatment in vogue were reduced to the
state of incompetency that society came to believe was
natural to them. “It was unwomanly for women to
think and act for themselves.” “Women had no concern
in public affairs.” “Men knew much better than
women did what was good for them,” were proverbs.</p>

<p class='c008'>By losing one privilege they lost others. New laws
were made prejudicial to their interests, and old laws retranslated
in a new and narrow spirit. Precedent gained
power to override statute; the notions of justice between
the sexes became warped and distorted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The laws of inheritance were altered, the rights of
women in their property further ignored. Sophistical
Labour Creeds were introduced to support masculine
property privilege. Work was ignoble for <i>ladies</i>, except
when done without remuneration; domestic work was
not cognisable in coin of the realm, therefore women
were said to be <i>supported</i> by their male relatives, though
they might labour ten times as much as they. It was
natural to educate them little, so that they should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>know; it was natural to take privileges from those who
knew not what they lost.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Protesting Women.</b>—But the Suppression of the Sex
did not go on without various Protests on the part of
women during the 200 years of this Backdraw in the
tide of Civilisation. We cannot spare time for every
detail; but three illustrative women must be noted—the
first born in the 16th Century, protesting against the
infringement of the Inheritance Laws in relation to
women; the second born in the 17th Century, against
the withdrawal of their educational advantages; the
third born in the 18th Century, against their social, civil
and political degradation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anne Clifford, born in 1590, was the only daughter of
George, Earl of Cumberland, and of his good wife,
Margaret Russel. She and her two noble sisters, Elizabeth,
Countess of Bath, and Anne, Countess of Warwick,
were distinguished for family affection, and all other
womanly virtues. The Countess of Warwick was Elizabeth’s
favourite Lady-in-Waiting. Anne was much with
this aunt in her youth, was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth,
and was destined for her court. Her father refused to
allow her, like other noble ladies of her time, to learn
ancient and modern languages, so she made the most of
the opportunities to be found in her own. “Her instructor
in her younger years was the learned Mr. Daniel,
the Historiographer and Poet. She was much interested
in searching out old documents about her ancestors and
very jealous of preserving her rights.” (<i>See</i> in Nicholson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and Burn’s “History of Cumberland and Westmoreland,
the Autobiography of Mr. Sedgwick, who was her Secretary.”)
She was well prepared by her beloved mother
and respected tutor for the exigencies of her future life.
The Queen died in 1602-3, and her father in 1605. A
woman being considered of age at 14, she chose her
mother as her guardian, who initiated the proceedings
against her brother-in-law, the new Earl of Cumberland,
which lasted until his death. The Earldom of Cumberland
had been entailed in Heirs Male, but the secondary
Titles, the Baronies of Clifford, Westmoreland, and
Vescy, with all the Lands and Castles in Westmoreland
belonging to them, were entailed in the Heir General.
Her uncle, however, took possession, and favoured by
the King, the power of wealth, and Sex Bias among
those in power, he was able to hold them against her, in
spite of her private and public petitions. His son,
Henry, was summoned to Parliament by the title of Lord
Clifford, a right which should have been hers, as she
bitterly complained. Meanwhile, in 1609, she married
Richard, Earl of Dorset. “On 25th July, 1610, my
cousin, Henry, married Lady Francis Cecil, daughter to
Robert, Earl Salisbury, which marriage was purposely
made that by that power and greatness of his the lands
of mine inheritance might be worsted and kept by strong
hand from me” (Harl. MS., 6177, Anne Clifford’s
Diary). 16th July, 1615, “the great trial for my lands
in Craven.” Her husband agreed with the Earl of
Cumberland to leave it to the King’s arbitration, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>she would never agree to, standing upon her rights. In
1617 she was brought before King James in Whitehall
to give her consent to the arbitration, “which I utterly
refused, and was thereby afterwards brought to many and
great troubles.” Her uncle offered £20,000 as a compromise
for the Westmoreland estates, which she would
not hear of, but which her prodigal husband urged her
to accept. Indeed, he attempted to strain his marital
rights, and backed by the King, signed the agreement
with her uncle, which she refused to acknowledge, and
defeated the plans of the trio by her firmness. For she
was a true descendant of the old stock of women, and
wished “to live and die with the feeling that she is receiving
what she must hand down to her children neither
tarnished nor depreciated, what future daughters-in-law
may receive, and so pass on to her grand children”
(Tac. Germ. c. 19). She was determined to hold by her
rightful inheritance. Her husband died on 28th March,
1624, and the contest went on with renewed vigour.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Domestic Series “State Papers,” vol. cxxvi. 7,
1628, there is preserved “Reasons to prove that by the
Common Law dignities conferred by Writ of Summons
to Parliament descend to females, where there is a sole
heir, and not co-heirs; being the reasons alleged for
Mary, Lady Fane, in her suit for the Barony of Abergavenny
in 1587, with other reasons alleged to show that
such dignities by custom and reason descend to heirs
female, produced on behalf of Anne claiming to be Lady
Clifford.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Also in same series, April, 1628, there is “The Petition
of Anne, Countess Dowager, late wife of Richard,
Earl of Dorset, deceased, and daughter and sole heir of
George, Earl of Cumberland, Lord Clifford, Westmoreland
and Vescy, to the King. On the death of her
father, the titles of Clifford, Westmoreland and Vescy
descended to the petitioner, yet Francis, Earl of Cumberland,
has published that the name of Lord Clifford and
that of Lord Vescy pertain to him; and Henry Clifford,
Chivaler, was summoned to this present Parliament, and
styles himself Lord Clifford ... prays the King to
admit her claim to the dignities of Clifford, Westmoreland
and Vescy, and to order the Earl of Cumberland and
Henry, his son, to forbear to style themselves by these
names.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1630 she married Philip, Earl of Montgomery, who
shortly afterwards became the Earl of Pembroke by the
death of his brother, and she again claimed her inheritance,
still, however, in vain. In 1641 died her uncle,
leaving one son, Henry, and one daughter, Elizabeth,
married to the Earl of Cork. Two years later her cousin
Henry died without heir male, and without further dispute,
Anne stepped into her inheritance, thereby proving
her original right. She had not sold it! “1644. So by
the death of this cousin German of mine, Henry Clifford
Earl of Cumberland, without heirs male, ye lands of mine
inheritance in Craven and Westmoreland reverted unto
me without question or controversie after y<sup>t</sup> his father
Francis Earl of Cumberland and this Earl Henry his son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>had unjustly detained from me the antient lands in Craven
from ye death of my father and ye lands in Westmoreland
from ye death of my mother until this time, yet had I
little or no profit from ye estate for some years after by
reason of ye civil wars.” On the death of her second
husband in 1649, she retired to the north, and began to
fortify her castles. The parliamentary forces demolished
them, but she said that as often as Cromwell pulled them
down she would build them up again. After a time,
admiring her spirit, the Protector gave orders she should
not be molested. She was not even yet free from litigation,
as at first she had troubles with her tenants. In
every case, however, through knowledge, experience, and
firmness she finally triumphed. A cloth-worker having
bought a property held under her by the yearly rent of
one hen, he refused to acknowledge her as his Seigneuress
by paying that small rent. But she sued him successfully,
and though she spent £200, she secured that hen, and
the right of which it was the symbol.</p>

<p class='c008'>She asserted all the privileges connected with her inheritance.
In her Diary she says, “As the King came
out of Scotland, when he lay at Yorke, there was a striffe
between my father and my Lord Burleighe who was then
President who should carie the sword; but it was
adjudged on my father’s side, because it was his office
by inheritance, and so is lineally descended upon me.”
She became High Sheriff of Westmoreland also by right
of her inheritance, and exercised its duties in person for a
time. “The 29th December, 1651, did I sign and seal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>a patent to Mr. Thomas Gabetis to be my Deputy Sheriff
of ye County of Westmoreland.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking back on her life in the quiet of her northern
home she said, “I must confess, with inexpressible thankfulness
that I was born a happy creature in mind, body,
and fortune, and that those two Lords of mine to whom
I was afterwards by the Divine providence married, were
in their several kinds worthy noblemen as any were in
this Kingdom. Yet was it my misfortune to have contradictions
and crosses with them both, with my first
Lord about the desire he had to make me sell my rights
in ye lands of mine inheritance for money, which I never
did nor never would consent unto, insomuch as this
matter was the cause of a long contention betwixt us, as
also for his profuseness in consuming his estate.” Her
dispute with her second husband arose because she would
not compel her daughter by her first husband, against the
girl’s desire, to marry his son by his first wife. The consequence
of these two disputes, in both of which she was
in the right, was that “the marble halls of Knoll and the
gilded towers of Wilton, were often to me the Bowers of
secret anguish.” She was not what has been called a
man’s woman, but she was essentially a woman’s woman.
All good women were her friends, her cousin the
Countess of Cork, daughter of her usurping uncle; her
sister-in-law the Countess of Dorset, wife of her brother-in-law,
whom she considered her greatest enemy. Though
King James was against her, Queen Anne was her warm
friend. She had no children by her second husband; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>her two sons by Earl Dorset died young. She had great
consolation in the affection first of her mother, then of
her two daughters, and also of her grandchildren. It
was in connection with one of these that an important
incident occurred, necessary to be fully explained here.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been allowed to utilise some critical points
communicated by me to the <i>Athenæum</i>, No. 3475, p. 709,
June 2, 1894.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an article on “Letter-writing,” published in <i>The
World</i>, April 5th, 1753, Sir Horace Walpole quotes the
famous and often repeated letter by Anne Clifford, Dowager-Countess
of Pembroke, to the Secretary of State, who
wanted her to nominate his follower for Appleby:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“I have been neglected by a Court, I have been
bullied by a usurper, but I will not be dictated to by a
subject. Your man sha’n’t stand.</p>
<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Anne Dorset</span>, Pembroke and Montgomery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lodge and other writers doubt its genuineness. The
author of the “Dictionary of National Biography” gives
as reasons for doubting it, that Sir Joseph Williamson, to
whom it was supposed to be addressed, was not made
Secretary of State until 1674; that Anne died in 1675,
and that there was no election between these dates; also,
that it was not in the style of her correspondence, and
the signature was unusual, because she always signed her
titles in the order of creation—Pembroke, Dorset, and
Montgomery—and not in the order of her two marriages.
None of the critics, however, seem to have followed out
the correspondence in the Domestic Series of “State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Papers” at the Public Record Office, which, though it
does not include the contested letter, yet illustrates it in
a remarkable manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Parliament elected in 1661, 13 Charles II., has
been called “The Long or Pensionary Parliament,” lasting
till 1678. (<i>See</i> “Parl. Returns,” vol. lxii., part i.,
p. 530.) John Lowther, Esq. of Hackthrop, and John
Dalston, Esq. of Accornbank, were Burgesses for Appleby.
John Lowther’s death necessitated a new election, and
in January, 1667-8, there was great excitement in and
about Appleby. From Anne’s position as High Sheriff
of the County, she had the right to nominate a Candidate;
from her great goodness and bounty to the place,
the Corporation were willing to gratify her by electing
whom she would. She determined to have one of her
grandsons the Tuftons, sons of her daughter, Countess
Thanet, four of whom were over 21, and in need of
occupation. Failing them, she meant to have selected
her kinsman, Anthony Lowther. But Joseph Williamson,
Secretary to Lord Arlington, then Secretary of State,
had set his heart on that seat, and by all means in his
power, open and underhand, attempted to secure it. He
was a native of those parts, and had friends and relatives
there, who all bestirred themselves in his favour. Everybody
“plied the Countess,” Williamson himself, his
brother and friends, the neighbouring gentry, the Justices
of the Peace, the Bishop of Winchester, Lord Arlington
himself. Her replies at first were very kindly, but they
gradually became more and more “definite.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Anne’s first letter, explaining how her interest was
engaged, dated Jan. 16th, 1667-8, was addressed to “Mr.
Secretary Williamson at Whitehall,” showing that there
is no weight in the argument as to Williamson’s appointment
not taking place till 1674, as being Under-Secretary,
he could be addressed so. Further, it is evident that
the contested letter was not addressed to Williamson,
but to Lord Arlington, about Williamson, though it may
certainly have been re-addressed, and sent to him later,
and may have been found among his papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Lord Arlington on Jan. 17th, she writes, “Mr.
Williamson, being of so eminent an ingenuity, cannot
miss a Burgess-ship elsewhere.” On Jan. 25th, Arlington
writes again to her on behalf of his Secretary. On Jan.
29th, George Williamson writes to his brother: “Unless
the three Tuftons be taken off by Lady Thanet’s means,
it is impossible for any man to oppose.... Dr. Smith
fears the taking off of the old Lady, but if done, we shall
be joyful.” Feb. 4th, Dan Fleming writes to Williamson
about plying the Lady Pembroke: “If you cannot accomplish
this, you should stay the Writ as long as you
can, until you have a good account of your interest in
Appleby.” The same day Dr. Smith wrote to Williamson
telling him of his friend’s work: “The success of it
will be seen by her answer to Lord Arlington, whereof
she showed me a copy. I cannot see how it is possible
to do any good unless her grandchildren be taken off.”
George Williamson writes same date to his brother, that
Lord Arlington had been urging Thomas Tufton to withdraw.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Neither Arlington nor the Bishop make any
impression on the wilful Countess.” On Feb. 6th, Lord
Arlington writes again, to whom Anne replies: “It was
myself and neither my daughter of Thanet, nor any of
my children, that made me attempt making one of her
sons a Burgess for Appleby.” “If it should happen
otherwise, I will submit with patience, but never yield
my consent. I know very well how powerful a man a
Secretary of State is throughout the King’s dominions,
so am confident that by your Lordship’s favour and
recommendation you might quickly help this Mr. Williamson
to a Burgess-ship without doing wrong or discourtesy
to a widow that wants but two years of fourscore,
and to her grandchildren whose father and mother
suffered as much in their worldly fortunes for the King,
as most of his subjects did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One can see that the spirited old lady has been kindled
to white heat, and that very little more would make her
say something very like what has been preserved by
Walpole.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to her style, she employed a Secretary, Mr. Sedgwick.
That Secretary was absent from Skipton Castle for
a few days at this time. It is just possible that the young
Candidate, Thomas Tufton himself, became her clerk on
the occasion, and transmitted his grandmother’s words as
he thought she said them, without anything of Sedgwick’s
clerkly polish.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Feb. 9th George Williamson writes to his brother,
enclosing a letter from Dr. Smith, “If the town be left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to their own freedom, your brother will carry it, but I
doubt that the Countess will never let it come to that,
being resolved to present one to them. If none of her
grandchildren will accept, she will pitch upon Anthony
Lowther. She has been heard to say that if they all
refuse, she will stand for it herself, by which you may
imagine what the issue is likely to be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Feb. 13th. Sir John Lowther to Williamson says, that
he had taken off his kinsman from the candidature.
“I believe that her Ladyship will prevail in her resolution
with regard to her relatives,” “and will neither
desire, seek, nor need, anybody’s help to make whom
she desires.” I know this by a letter from the Mayor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Feb. 23, Thomas Gabetis, Under-Sheriff, writes to Mr.
Williamson, that he studied to serve him, but the
Countess had planned otherwise. “The Corporation
being disposed to gratify her for her great nobleness and
bounty to the place. My station obligates me to render
service with obedience to her commands, especially in
this particular.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here comes the period at which the undated letter
preserved by Walpole might well have been written.
But between him and the printers it seems to have disappeared.
There is no further letter now on the subject
among the State Papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in her Diary, Harl. MS., she writes, “And on ye
second day of March in this year my grandchild, Mr.
Thomas Tufton, was chosen Burgess of ye Town of
Appleby to serve in the House of Commons in Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>therein assembled, and sitting in Parliament at
Westminster, in ye place of Mr. John Lowther, my
cosin’s son, who dyed; so as Mr. Thomas Tufton, my
grandchild, begann first of all to sitt in ye said House
of Commons at Westminster as a member thereof, the
10th day of March, he being ye first grandchild of mine
yt ever sate in ye House of Commons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On 21st Sept., 1668, in 1670, and in 1674, this Mr.
Thomas Tufton visited his grandmother and his constituency,
still Burgess.</p>

<p class='c008'>So she had her way with the Secretary of State, as
she had had with the King, the Protector, and her noble
husbands. Her motto, it may be remembered, was
“Preserve your loyalty, defend your rights.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Many other women have been right in their contentions,
but to very few have been given with the spirit and
courage, the wealth, power, patience and opportunity to
secure success. Her struggle was no purely personal one;
it was the first Protest against the invasion of the rights of
her sex. She saw how “legal precedent” was drifting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Joshua Williams on Land Settlement says, “I
have not been able to discover any trace of a limitation
of an estate, tail, or any other estate to an unborn
son prior to 3 and 4 Philip and Mary” (“Judicial
Papers,” vol. i., part i., p. 47).</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already noted the decision of Judge Popham
in the case of Lady Fane, which Anne Clifford quoted
as precedent for her own case in vain. She utilised
every opportunity of improving herself and blessing her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>fellow-creatures. She would not go where she could do
no good. Being invited to the Court of Charles II. she
replied, “I could not go, unless I were to wear blinkers,
like my horses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Donne said of her, that she “was able to converse
on any subject, from predestination to slea-silk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In her Funeral Sermon, preached by Bishop Rainbow,
he mentioned her learning, hospitality, and encouragement
of letters, and reckoned among her many virtues,
Courage, Humility, Faith, Charity, Piety, Wisdom.
“Thus died this great wise Woman, who, while she
lived, was the Honour of her Sex and her Age, fitter for
a History than a Sermon.”</p>

<p class='c008'><b>In 1694 Mary Astell protested</b> against the state of
things in her day in a small anonymous publication, “A
Serious Proposal to the Ladies, by a Lover of their Sex.”
Speaking of the repute learning was held in about 150
years ago, she says, “It was so very modish that the fair
Sex seemed to believe that Greek and Latin added to
their charms, and Plato and Aristotle untranslated were
frequent ornaments of their closets. One would think
by the effects that it was a proper way of educating
them, since there are no accounts in history of so many
great women in any one age as are between 1500 and
1600.” She refers to Mr. Wotton’s “Reflections on
Ancient and Modern Learning,” p. 349, and makes clear
that her proposal is to found an institution for the higher
education of women, to be dedicated to the Princess
Anne of Denmark. In 1696 she also published “An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Essay in Defence of the Female Sex, by a Lady.” Defoe
next year in his “Essays on Projects,” proposed to establish
Academies for women, and criticises “the Lady”
who had suggested the idea under the conditions of a
Monastery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reflections upon Marriage” appeared in 1700. In
the third edition of the latter, 1706, answering objections,
in the Preface, she says, “These Reflections have no
other design than to correct some abuses which are none
the less because power and prescription seem to authorise
them. ’Tis a great fault to submit to Authority when
we should only yield to Reason,” ... “designing nothing
but the Pubic Good, and to return, if possible, the
native Liberty, the Rights and Privileges of the Subject....
She did not indeed advise women to think men’s
folly wisdom, nor his brutality that love and worship he
promised in the matrimonial oath, for this required a
flight of wit and sense much above her poor ability, and
proper only to masculine understandings.... ’Tis true,
through want of learning and of that superior genius
which men, as men, lay claim to, she was ignorant of the
natural inferiority of our sex, which our masters lay down
as a self-evident and fundamental truth. She saw nothing
in the reason of things to make this either a principle
or a conclusion, but very much to the contrary, it
being Sedition, at least, if not Treason, to assert it in
this Reign. For if by <i>the natural superiority of their Sex</i>
they mean that every man is superior to every woman,
which is the obvious meaning, and that which must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>stuck to if they would speak sense, it would be a sin in
any woman to have dominion over any man, and the
greatest Queen ought not to command, but to obey her
Footman, because no municipal Laws can supersede or
change the Laws of Nature. If they mean that some
men are superior to some women, that is no great discovery.
Had they turned the tables they would have
found that some women are superior to some men. Or,
had they remembered their Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy,
they might have known that one woman is
superior to all the men in the Kingdom, or else they
have sworn to very little purpose, and it must not be
supposed that their Reason and Religion would suffer
them to take Oaths contrary to the Law of Nature and
the Reason of Things.” “That the Custom of the World
has put women, generally speaking, into a state of subjection,
is not denied; but the right can be no more
proved by the fact than the predominance of vice can
justify it. They say that Scripture shows that women
were in a state of subjection. So were the Jews, under
the Chaldeans; and the Christians under the Romans.
Were they necessarily inferior? That ingenious theorist,
Mr. Whiston, argues, ‘that before the Fall woman was
the superior.’ Woman is put into the World to serve
God. The service she owes a man at any time is only a
business by-the-bye, just as it may be any man’s business
to keep hogs. He was not made for this, but if he hires
himself out to such an employment, he ought conscientiously
to perform it.... We do not find any man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>think any the worse of his understanding because another
has more physical power, or conclude himself less capable
for any post because he has not been preferred to it....
If all men are born Free, how are all women born
slaves? Not Milton himself would cry up Liberty for
Female Slaves, or plead the Lawfulness of resisting a
private Tyranny.... If mere power gives a right to rule,
there can be no such thing as Usurpation, but a Highwayman,
so long as he has Strength to force, has also a
right to command our obedience. Strength of mind
goes along with Strength of body, and ’tis only for some
odd accidents, which philosophers have not yet thought
worth while to inquire into, that the sturdiest porter is
not also the wisest man.... Sense is a portion that
God has been pleased to distribute to both sexes with an
impartial hand; but learning is what men have engrossed
to themselves, and one cannot but admire their improvements.”
She winds up with another Eulogy on the good
Queen Anne. But society did not then reform itself upon
her suggestions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the close of the eighteenth century, however,
<b>Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin blew a loud trumpet blast</b>,
in her indignant “Vindication of the Rights of Women.”
She treats the subject on lines that men and women are only
now beginning to learn to read. “There can be no duty
without reason. There can be no morality without
equality. There can be no justice when its recipients
are only of one sex. Let us first consider women in the
broad light of human creatures, who, in common with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>men, are placed upon the earth to unfold their faculties.”
“Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partakes
with him the gift of reason? Do you not act a tyrant’s
part when you force <i>all</i> women by denying them civil
and political rights, to remain immured in their families,
groping in the dark? Surely you will not assert that a
duty can be binding that is not founded on reason.”
“Women may be convenient slaves, but slavery will
have its constant effect, degrading both the master and
the abject dependent.” “It is time to effect a revolution
in female manners, time to restore to women their
lost dignity and to make them labour by reforming themselves,
to reform the world.” She was too much in advance
of her times to be successful in spreading her views,
especially as they were entangled with other opinions
even more unpopular in her day. Yet she sowed the
seed that is still growing. The society she pictures
gives a painful illustration of the effects of the exclusively
masculine creeds of her century.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet, during that dark age of women’s privilege, there
were <b>some Legal Cases tried</b> and decided, refreshing
in their results, as they showed that dispassionate judges
could still do something for women, when they followed
the ordinary principles of Philology, and decreed that a
common term could stand for woman as well as for
man, even when it meant a privilege.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A woman was appointed by the Justices to be a <i>governor</i>
of a workhouse at Chelmsford in Essex, and Mr.
Parker moved to quash the order because it was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>office not suitable to her sex, but the Justices upheld
the appointment” (2 Lord Raymond, 1014). “My
Lady Broughton was <i>keeper</i> of the Gatehouse Prison”
(3 Keble, 32). “A woman was appointed clerk in the
King’s Bench” (<i>see</i> Showers’ P.C.).</p>

<p class='c008'>A lady’s appointment to be <i>Commissioner</i> of Sewers
was also contested, but it was “decided that as the office
by statute” shall be granted to such <i>person</i> or persons as
the said Lords should appoint, “the word <i>person</i> stands
indifferently for either sex ... and though women have
been discreetly spared ... yet I am of opinion, for the
authorities and reasons aforesaid, that this appointment
is <i>warrantable in law</i>. Women have been secluded as
unfit, but they are not in law to be excluded as incapable,”
<i>i.e.</i>, the election determined eligibility; and so the
Countess of Warwick was allowed to retain the benefits
of her election. (<i>See</i> Callis. 250.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In Hilary Term, 1739, the case of Olive <i>v.</i> Ingram
was heard before Sir William Lee, Chief-Justice, Sir
Francis Page, Sir Edmund Probyn, Sir William Chappel,
Justices, to decide whether a woman could vote for a
sexton, and whether she could be a sexton. A woman
candidate for the office of sexton of the Church of St.
Botolphs without Bishopsgate had 169 <i>indisputable</i>
votes and 40 <i>women’s votes</i>; the plaintiff had 174 indisputable
votes and 22 women’s votes. The woman had
been declared elected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case was considered so important that it was heard
four times. First, whether a woman could vote? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>counsel against argued that women could not vote in this
case, as they did not do so in others; that they did not
vote for members of Parliament, quoting Coke. The
counsel for argued that non-user did not imply inability;
that women paying Scot and Lot had a right to vote on
municipal affairs; that they voted in the great Companies;
that it had been decided in Attorney-General
<i>v.</i> Nicholson that women had a right to elect a preacher.
If they could elect to a higher office, how could they not
do so to a lower? It had been decided in Holt <i>v.</i> Lyle
and Catharine <i>v.</i> Surrey, according to Hakewell, “that a
<i>feme sole</i>, if she has a freehold, may vote for a Parliament
man.” Women did come to the old County Courts,
though not compellable thereto. Women are <i>sui juris</i>
till they are married.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Lord Chief-Justice said the case of Holt <i>v.</i>
Lyle is a very strong case, but as I am not bound now
to say whether a woman can vote for a Parliament
man, I will reserve that point for further consideration.
The question here is, whether a woman can be
included in “all <i>persons</i> paying Scot and Lot.” It was
a just rule that they who contributed to maintain the
elected should themselves be electors. There is a difference
between exemption and incapacity. If women are
qualified to pay Scot and Lot, they are qualified to keep
a sexton. They who pay must determine to whom they
will pay. He decided that women could vote for a sexton.
Justice Page agreed with Chief-Justice Lee on the
general question, but added, “I see no disability in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>woman for voting for a Parliament man.” Justice Probyn
agreed that they who pay have a right to nominate. It
<i>might be thought</i> that it required an <i>improved understanding</i>
for a woman to vote for a Parliament man, but the
case of Holt <i>v.</i> Lyle was a very strong case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman having thus secured a majority of “indisputable
votes,” the next question was, could she hold
office? The objection was that women could not hold
places of trust, of exertion, of anything to do with a church.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chief-Justice Lee said a woman is allowed to be a
Constable, an Overseer, a Governor of a Poorhouse, a
Gaoler, a Keeper of a Prison, a Churchwarden, a Clerk
of the Crown in the King’s Bench. Very high offices
have been held by Ladies. In regard to the Church,
women have been allowed to baptise; there have been
Deaconesses, and female servants <i>circa sacra</i>. (Romans
xvi. 21.) Women have presented to churches. He
decided that a woman <i>could be sexton</i>. The others
concurred. (Leach’s “Modern Term Reports,” vol. vii.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Strange, the opposing counsel, in reporting the case
shortly and confusingly, says that he knew many women
sextons at the time. (<i>See</i> 27 Strange.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the case of Rex <i>v.</i> Chardstock, where “the parish
was obstinate in not having another Overseer than a
woman,” Justice Powell had testily declared that a woman
cannot be Overseer of the Poor, that there <i>can be no custom
of the parish to appoint her, because it is an Office</i><a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c023'><sup>[16]</sup></a> <i>created</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><i>by Act of Parliament</i>. To the petitioner’s election he
replied that there was <i>not to be a woman Overseer</i>, an
<i>obiter dictum</i> reversed in the King’s Bench in 1788 in
Rex <i>v.</i> Stubbs. “Can a woman be Overseer of the
poor?” the only qualification necessary by the Statute<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c023'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
(43 Eliza.), is that the Overseer be “a substantial householder.”
A woman can be “a substantial householder,
and therefore she is eligible.” Justice Ashurst referred
to the other offices that women had held, as quoted above.
“This office has no reference to sex. The only question
is whether there be anything in the nature of
the office that should make a woman incompetent, and
we think <i>there is not</i>” (Durnford and East’s “Term
Reports”).</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet before the time that male rivals contested the election
with a woman, women had exercised the office without
objection. “In the township of Gorton, parish of
Manchester, 1748, Widow Waterhouse was overseer of
the poor. In 1775 Sarah Schofield played the flute in
the chapel choir. In 1826 Mary Grimston appointed
sexton. In 1829 the vestry sent for Ruth Walker to come
and break stones” (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5th series, vol. iv.,
p. 269). In the Parish Register, Totteridge, Middlesex,

<p class='c008'>The opening of the nineteenth century was signalised
by the cessation of the Napoleonic wars; and the Peace
brought wider opportunities of leisure, learning, and
literature to both sexes. Yet so powerful had become
the force of Custom in confusing men’s ideas of Justice,
that even James Mill, the pupil of Jeremy Bentham, in
his masterly article on “Government” for the Supplement
to the “Cyclopædia Britannica” (afterwards republished
in pamphlet form, 1825) could allow it to blind his eyes
to the logical results of his own reasoning. In page 494
he says, “That one human being will desire to render
the person and property of another subservient to his
pleasures, notwithstanding the pain or loss of pleasure
which it may occasion to that other individual, <i>is the
foundation of government</i>. The desire of the object implies
the desire of the power necessary to accomplish the
object. The desire, therefore, of that power which is
necessary to render the persons and properties of other
human beings subservient to our pleasures, is a grand
governing law of human nature.” Yet the writer of this
searching analysis of the cause and need of government
says elsewhere (p. 300), “One thing is pretty clear, that
all those individuals whose interests are indisputably
included in those of other individuals, may be struck off
from political rights without inconvenience. In this light
may be viewed all children up to a certain age, whose
interests are involved in those of their parents. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>light, also, women may be regarded, the interest of
<i>almost all of whom</i> is involved in either that of their
fathers or that of their husbands.” Yet even at that
early date a man, inspired by a woman, rose up to protest
against this sweeping assertion. William Thompson,
in 1825, published a little book, dedicated to Mrs.
Wheeler, that puts the whole question in a broad modern
light, “<i>The Appeal</i> of one Half of the Human Race,
Women, against the Pretensions of the other Half, Men,
to retain them in Political, and thence in Civil and
Domestic Slavery. In reply to a paragraph of Mr.
Mill’s celebrated article on Government.” This interesting
book was the first voice of a nineteenth century man
against the degradation of women. He points out that
Mill has not nearly reached the level of his master,
Bentham, in his conception. He asks, what is to become
of those not included in the “nearly all”? what of
those that are? “Why are women’s interests included in
those of men? Mr. Mill’s article seeks to evade the
equal claims of the other half of the human race to
similar protection against the abuse of the same power,
against the application of the general principle of security
to women.” “In order to include women in the proscription
of children, a fiction must be manufactured, as
none of the good reasons applicable to children would
be found to apply to women, and this romance of an
identity of interest is the ingenious, say rather, the
vulgar, the audacious fiction devised” (p. 15). “From
this examination it results that the pretext set up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>exclude women from political rights, namely, the inclination
of men to use power over them beneficently;
would, if admitted, sweep away the grand argument itself
for the political rights of men.” “We shall investigate the
philosophical pretext of the ‘article’ for the degradation
of one half of the adult portion of the human race in
the following order:—(1) Does the identity of interest
between men and women, in point of fact, exist?
(2) If it do exist, is it a sufficient cause, or any reason
at all, why either of the parties, with interests thus
identified, should therefore be deprived of political
rights? (3) Is there in the nature of things any security
for equality of enjoyments proportional to exertion and
capabilities, but by means of equal civil rights? or any
security for equal civil but by means of equal political
rights? In regard to the first, there are three great
classes of women. First, all women without fathers or
husbands; second, adult daughters in their father’s
establishment; third, wives. The first class have no
men to identify their interests with; they are therefore the
class, sometimes scornfully called, <i>the unprotected</i>. Adult
daughters can acquire legal rights as against their fathers,
but on marriage they forfeit their freedom, and are again
thrown back into the class of children or idiots.” “Involving
of interests must mean that one enjoys as
much as the other, is this true as between husband
and wife?” “The very assumption of despotic power
by the husbands over wives is in itself a demonstration,
that in the opinion of husbands, a contrariety, and not an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>involving of interests, exists between them and their
wives. Domestic despotism corrupts man’s moral frame.”
“If it is more difficult for women to labour, why should
men further increase the difficulty by protecting themselves?
In justice to the stronger excluding party, as
well as to the weaker, all such powers of excluding ought
to be withheld” (p. 149).</p>

<p class='c008'>Many must have read, but few assimilated Mr.
Thompson’s able and generous arguments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, in regard to the Representation of the
People’s Acts, the parliamentary franchises had been revised
and cobbled, but in none was any but the general
term used. The Act 7 and 8 William III. describes electors
as “freeholders,” or “persons”; 18 George II., c.
xviii., 19 George II., c. xxviii., use the same general
terms. That of 3 George III. limits the franchise “to
persons who had taken up their freedom for 12 months.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Those of 11 George III., c. lv.; 22 George III., c.
xxxi.; 44 George III., c. lx.; 11 George IV., and 1
William IV., c. lxxiv., confer the suffrage on “<i>every</i>
Freeholder being above the age of 21 years, or on
inhabitant householders of same age.” There is no
term ever used, that might not include a woman. But
just at the time when the tide of civilisation and education
was beginning to rise again, just after “The Appeal
of Women” had appeared, by W. Thompson and Mrs.
Wheeler (1825), all historical precedent was reversed.
Concentrated social <i>opinion</i> became boldly expressed in <i>law</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>In the Reform Bill of 1832</b>, the word “male”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was interpolated before “persons” in the Charters of the
newly created Boroughs. Never before, and never since
has the phrase “male persons” appeared in any Statute
of the Realm. By this Act, therefore, women were legally
disfranchised for the first time in the history of the
English Constitution. The privilege of abstention was
converted into the penalty of exclusion. Curiously
enough, the framers seemed to have had dim notions of this,
as in all reference to older Charters the term “person”
only appeared, and the interpolating adjective “male”
is suppressed. Therefore in Boroughs holding by older
Charters women were not necessarily excluded, except
by the reflex action of the 1832 Statute. (<i>See</i> 2 William
IV., c. xlv., s. 24, 25, 31, 32, and 33.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In strange contrast to the spirit of this Act were the
Bills passed in 1833 and 1834, which gave freedom,
at the nation’s expense, to all Colonial slaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Municipal Franchises naturally followed the example
of the Parliamentary one, and in spite of Charter,
and in spite of precedent, limited their privileges to
“male persons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For many years these readings remained in uncontested
force, not without protest on the part of women
and of the friends of justice. In 1851, Lord Romilly’s
Bill, otherwise called Lord Brougham’s Bill, “for shortening
the language of the Acts of Parliament,” was passed.
This decided that the word “man” should always include
“woman” except where otherwise expressly stated.
In that year the Earl of Carlisle presented a Petition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>drafted at a public meeting in Sheffield for the extension
of the Parliamentary Suffrage to women. Sympathetic
minds were stirred by the great American Convention of
the subject, and in the <i>Westminster and Foreign
Quarterly</i>, July, 1851, appears the notable article on
“The Enfranchisement of Women,” by Mrs. Mill.
“That women have as good a claim as men have to the
suffrage and to be jury, it would be difficult for any one
to deny.” “It is one axiom of English freedom that
taxation and representation always go together; it is
another that all persons must be tried by their peers, yet
<i>both</i> are denied to women.” “A reason must be given
why what is permitted to one person is interdicted to
another.” “Far from being <i>expedient</i>, the division of
mankind into two castes, one born to rule the other, is
an unqualified mischief, a source of perversion and demoralisation
both to the favoured class and to those at
whose expense they are favoured, producing none of the
good which it is the custom to ascribe to it, and forming
a bar to any really vital improvement either in the character
or the social condition of the human race.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the boast of modern Europeans and Americans
that they know and do many things which their fore-fathers
neither knew nor did; it is the most unquestionable
point of their superiority that custom is not now the
tyrant that it formerly was. Yet in this case prejudice
appeals to custom and authority.” “Great thinkers
from Plato to Condorcet have made emphatic protests in
favour of the equality of women.” “We deny the right of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>any portion of the species to decide for another portion,
or any individual for another individual what is and what
is not their ‘proper sphere.’ The proper sphere of all
human beings is the largest and highest they can attain to.”</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Bill of 1867.</b> Again the “Representation of the
people” came before the House in 1867. The word “man”
was exchanged for “male persons” of the 1832 Charter.
John Stuart Mill redeemed his father’s errors and moved
an Amendment that it should be made expressly to include
women. “We ought not to deny to them what we
are conceding to everyone else, a right to be consulted;
of having, what every petty trade or profession has, a few
members who feel specially called on to attend to their
interests, to point out how these interests are affected by
law.” “The want of this protection has affected their
interests vitally. The rich can make private laws unto
themselves by settlements, but what of the poor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Educational endowments founded for both sexes have
been limited to boys. The medical profession shuts its
doors when women strive to enter in. The Royal
Academy shut its doors when women began to distinguish
themselves. There is no meaning in the objection
that women have no time to attend to politics. Do all
enfranchised men take time?” “What is the meaning of
political freedom? Is it anything but the control of
those that make politics by those who do not?” (p. 7).
His Amendment was lost. But so also was the Amendment
that the phrase “male persons” of 1832 should be
replaced. The Bill enacted that every man of full age,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and not subject to legal incapacity, “duly qualified and
registered,” should have the right to vote. During the
discussion, the Hon. G. Denman, Justice of the Common
Pleas, asked the following question—“Why, instead of
the words ‘male person’ of the Act of 1832, the word
‘man’ had been substituted in the present Bill? In the
fifth clause of the Bill he found that after saying that
every ‘man’ should be entitled to be registered, it proceeds
to say, ‘<i>or a male person</i> in any university who has
passed any senior middle examination.’ In the light of
Lord Romilly’s Act, if the Court of Queen’s Bench had
to decide to-morrow on the construction of these clauses
they <i>would be constrained</i> to hold that they <i>conferred the</i>
suffrage on <i>female persons</i> as well as on males.” The
Government did not answer the question, but it passed
the Bill as it stood. This, therefore, to ordinary, as
well as to logical minds, seemed to reinstate women in
their ancient though neglected privileges, which the advance
of education had taught them now to appreciate.
Therefore, next year, 5,347 women had themselves duly
registered in the town of Manchester alone, in the
neighbouring town of Salford about 1,500, and large
numbers in other places. Great uncertainty prevailed
as to how to treat them, but most of the revising barristers
threw them out. The Manchester women consolidated
their claims and appealed against their decision.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The case of Chorlton</b> <i>v.</i> <b>Lings</b> was heard before the
Court of Common Pleas in Westminster, Nov. 7th and
10th, 1868, Lord Chief-Justice Bovill and Justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Willes, Keating and Byles, sitting on the Bench. The
facts can be found in the Law Reports, and it is good
that they should be recalled to the minds of the rising
generation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet they are treated in a more lively manner in the
pages of <i>The Times</i>. Mr. Coleridge, Q.C., and Dr.
Pankhurst appeared on behalf of the women, Mr.
Mellish against. Miss Becker, the woman’s champion,
was present, and many other ladies. Mr. Coleridge
stated that there were 5,347 women duly registered in
the town of Manchester, qualified <i>except by sex</i> to be
electors. The Chief-Justice asked him if he had found
any cases of women exercising political privileges before
then? He said he had not!<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c023'><sup>[18]</sup></a> But he added that the
Statute for the County Courts <i>might</i> have included both
sexes. The Chief-Justice interpolated, “The Common
Law existed before the Statute Law. There is no trace,
so far as I know, of women having been admitted to the
assemblies of the wise men of the land!”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c023'><sup>[19]</sup></a> (Laughter.)
Mr. Coleridge gave the examples of the Countess of
Westmoreland voting by attorney and Mrs. Copley signing
the indenture. Justice Willes interposed, “She
might have been a returning officer, which office she
unquestionably might fill!”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c023'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Mr. Coleridge then
quoted Luders as to the women burgesses of Lyme
Regis; the Statute of Henry VI., which limited suitors
to forty shilling freeholders and the citizen burgesses, as
all being enacted of “chusers” or “electors” in common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>terms. Hallam (ch. xiii.), states that “all Householders
paying Scot and Lot, and Local Rates, voted for members
of Parliament.” Women could be freeholders,
householders, citizens, burgesses, suitors, taxpayers,
therefore they could vote. It is true that the Reform
Bill of 1832 read these as only applied to “male persons,”
but the Bill of 1867 used the term “man,” while Lord
Romilly’s Act had decided the term “man” should include
woman, unless where it was otherwise expressly
stated. It was not “otherwise expressly stated” in the
Statute of 1867. There was no legal restraint against
women voting, and he quoted the case of Holt <i>v.</i> Lyle,
which affirmed that a <i>feme sole</i> had a right to vote for a
Parliament man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Mellish, in opposition, said that Manchester was
a new Borough in 1832, and claimed by its Charter the
franchise for “male persons.” The Bill of 1867 stated
that it would not alter existing franchises. The ground
of women being excluded was their <i>legal incapacity</i>. It
is true no statute took their right away, because they
never had it! “As well suitors as others,” of 52
Henry III., did not necessarily mean women. “They
could not be Esquires or Knights.” Justice Willes interposing—“Not
only in Books of Romance but in
Books of Chivalry we see they can!” “The case
quoted by Mr. Coleridge is valueless. If a lady were
not present to vote, it was clearly illegal for her to do so
by attorney. Mrs. Copley was Patron of the Borough,
and probably acted as returning officer. In Olive <i>v.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Ingram the majority of the Judges were against the
woman’s claim.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c023'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Peeresses could not sit in the House
of Lords.” Justice Willes interposing—“Yet peeresses
marrying commoners, the commoners became Peers, and
sat <i>jure mariti</i>. Is not that, at least, representative of a
woman?” Mr. Mellish then referred to the parallel
case that had been tried in Scotland. Judgment was
against the women, first, because they were legally incapacitated;
and second, because to <i>give</i> them a vote
would be against public policy, as it was a premium on
ladies to remain unmarried in order to retain their votes,
and a premium to them to desire that their husbands
might die in order that they might become enfranchised
as widows.” Mr. Coleridge said that the Scotch case
had no bearing on this. Lord Chief-Justice Bovill
was obliged to concede that “it is quite true that a
few women being parties to indentures of returns of
members of Parliament have been shown, and it is quite
possible that there may have been some other instances
in early times of women having voted and assisted in
legislation. Indeed, such instances are mentioned by
Selden. Yet the fact of the right not having been
asserted for centuries raises a very strong presumption
against its ever having had legal existence.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c023'><sup>[22]</sup></a> And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>though he acknowledged that in many statutes “man”
may be properly held to include women, he decided
against this interpretation here. The rest of the judges
agreed with him.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He could only have read the short and misleading report by
Strange, the counsel for the opposition, as the assertion does not
seem borne out by the case <i>in extenso</i>. As Strange also affirmed
that women could not hold by military tenure, his judgment regarding
them on other points may well be doubted.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The last recorded example of women proffering their vote was
in 1640, less than 260 years before, p. 99. While Amersham and other
towns had not voted for 321 years, p. 92.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The second case, Chorlton <i>v.</i> Ressler, a woman
freeholder at Rusholme with a county qualification
with no relation to the 1832 Charter of Manchester,
they refused to hear. Dr. Pankhurst was silenced.
The Lord Chief-Justice said to him—“Do you expect to
convince us that we are wrong, and that we ought to
alter our judgment just given?” Dr. Pankhurst—“Your
judgment is inchoate, and might be altered during the
term. (Laughter.) This is not a point of Common
Law but of Constitutional Law.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next case was Wilson <i>v.</i> Town Clerk of Salford;
Martha Wilson having appeared on the Overseer’s List,
and not having been objected to, wanted to know why
she had been struck out. She was curtly referred to the
decision in Chorlton <i>v.</i> Lings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next case, Bennet <i>v.</i> Bromfit, was a consolidated
appeal of men and women against the revising
barrister at Ormskirk, who had held that certain
notices of objection were valid, without the reasons of
objection being stated. Here the Revising Barrister
had decided that Ellen Ashcroft was qualified to vote.
The Lord Chief-Justice interposed—“The Revising
Barrister may have decided that Ellen Ashcroft had a right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to vote, but we have decided that she has not.” “But,
your Lordship, what has to become of Birch, Roberts and
the other men concerned in this appeal?” “It is laid
down that where appeals are improperly consolidated they
cannot be heard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And thus, in a Court of Common Law, amid peals of
amused laughter, the Constitutional Privilege of British
Freewomen was taken from them, as a Justice worded
it, “<i>forever</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet Coke himself had declared “Judges ought not
to give any opinion of a matter of Parliament because
it is not decided by the Common Law, but <i>secundum
legem et consuetudini</i> Parliamenti” (“Fourth Institute,”
15).</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1704, the Commons had resolved that “they cannot
judge of the right of elections without determining
the right of electors; and if the electors were at liberty
to prosecute suits touching the right of giving voices
in other courts, there might be different voices in other
courts which would make confusion and be dishonourable
to the House of Commons, and that such an action
was a breach of privilege.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But this decision was accepted from the Common Law
Courts, and, by Christmas, 1868, there was not a “Freewoman”
left in Britain, except the <i>One</i> who sat on the
throne, holding her privileges, not as her female subjects
did, by Statutes written in general terms, but by Statutes
where the language designates the male sex alone.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>It</span> was not only the seven thousand women from
Manchester and Salford who were disappointed in the
results of their appeal. Women began on all sides to
analyse the grounds of the judgment, and to take steps
towards counteracting its baneful influence. An ever-increasing
body of generous-hearted or far-seeing men
joined their party, and worked with, and for them, both
within and without the House of Commons. Meeting
after meeting has spread enthusiasm. Petition after
Petition has been presented. Bill after Bill has been
brought forward. Amendment after Amendment has
been proposed hitherto without success. As Mr. Stuart,
M.P., once wittily said at a public meeting, “Petitions
sent up by the Unrepresented, are like Bell-handles rung
outside of a door, that have no bell attached at the other
end. They occupy the attention of those outside of the
house, but do not disturb those that are within.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>The strongest plea has been taken from women. By
the extension of the Franchise in 1884, the Service
Clause disallowed the doctrine that taxation was the
qualification for representation, and reversed the prime
reason of members being first called to the House in
the reign of Hen. III. If women had felt it hard
that their payment of taxes had not been sufficient to
purchase their right of representation, they felt it harder
that their payment of taxes, invalid and inoperative as
regards themselves, was valid and operative as providing
the qualification of their male servants, that, in short, the
qualification had been altered fundamentally. Yet some
good has come out of the evil. It has provided a <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i>.</p>
<p class='c008'>It has made women see clearly that no qualification,
but that of sex, lies in the modern readings of the
Statutes. They cannot alter the sex, but they may alter
the Basis of Privilege. Such things have been done ere
now. Ripe scholars in Mathematics have been excluded
the Universities because they could not subscribe to the
articles of the English Church. Political Economists
have been excluded the House of Commons because
they were of Jewish descent. These disabilities have
been removed for men. The disabilities of sex must ere
long be removed for women.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Progress has been very rapid since 1868.</b>—The
“woman’s question” no longer provokes somnolence
nor awakes mirth: it is treated as a question of gravity.
The publication of John Stuart Mills’ “Subjection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Women,” in 1869, educated many minds. The humorous
treatment of the question in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i> in the
article entitled, “Latest News from the Planet Venus,”
where logical objections against Male Enfranchisement
are supposed to be urged by women, taught others that
there were two sides to the principles of exclusion, and
that those against the Enfranchisement of men, were, to
say the least of it, quite as valid, as any that have ever
been brought against the Liberty of Women. Many
other interesting volumes and articles have been written,
making the views of women known.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women have begun to speak for themselves, and to
speak clearly—with no uncertain sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>No new elucidation of the 1867 Charter has taken place
except one very remarkable one. “If a woman’s name
were to get on an <i>election list by mistake</i>, and she afterwards
tenders her vote, that vote must be accepted”
(<i>see</i> “Warren on Election Law”). The humour of the
remark is great. As by the mistakes of some men women
lost their rights, by a further masculine mistake they
may regain them. Is this what it imports? If not,
what?</p>

<p class='c008'>The 1868 Decision threw back civilisation theoretically
2000 years. But it necessitated opposition. One clear
sign of this effect was given in 1869 when Mr. Jacob
Bright moved a resolution in the House that women
should vote in Municipal affairs, and it was adopted
almost without discussion. The Bill was modified, but
reconfirmed in 1882. The right has been exercised by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>women since that time without any overturning of the
social fabric.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1870 the vote for the School Board, and eligibility
thereto, was conferred upon them. Ancient rights
allowed them to vote for Poor Law Guardians; and in
1888 they were allowed to vote for County Councillors.
In 1893 they were made electors, and eligible for election
on Parish District Councils.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many Bills have been passed in their favour through
the toil and energy of devoted women, and the co-operation
of broad-minded men.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Married Women’s Property Acts</b> of 1870 and
of 1882 have secured the earnings of industrious wives
from the clutches of grasping or drunken husbands
to a certain degree. A slight improvement has taken
place in regard to the Custody of Infant Children. The
Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1884 took a step in
the right direction, though sadly crippled by its overriding
conditions. (<i>See</i> Mrs. Fawcett’s pamphlet on
“The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1884.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>Various other moral Bills have showed the woman’s
spirit working behind the scenes in favour of justice
and mercy and chastity.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the famous Clitheroe case, in 1891, which sent
back the Judge, through lack of Precedent, to the original
Statutes to find a decision as to the imprisonment of a
wife, bewildered the populace, and reduced the demand
for wife-kicking boots.</p>

<p class='c008'>Public Conscience is beginning to be awakened to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>errors of its judgments in regard to women. The disproportionate
awards of punishment to those who steal
food when hungry, and those who maltreat their wives
through tyranny, do not so often now arouse the indignation
of those who read the Law Reports in newspapers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the tide has not been uniform in its motion. It
is the way of waves to retire before and after a rise.</p>

<p class='c008'>I forbear enlarging on the last great decision regarding
women’s disabilities, by which the Judge, following the
example of his predecessor in Rex <i>v.</i> Chardcroft, refused
the electors of Brixton a right to elect Lady Sandhurst as
County Councillor, and put another in her place that
the majority of them had not elected; refused also to the
County Councillors themselves their right of electing
Miss Cons among their Aldermen. On May 16th, 1889,
in the Queen’s Bench Division, was tried the case of
Beresford-Hope <i>v.</i> Lady Sandhurst. The other candidates
had given notice of objections to the Lady, but the
Deputy disallowed these, studying only the Statute. There
were 1986 votes recorded in favour of Lady Sandhurst,
and 1686 in favour of Beresford-Hope, who appealed.
It was allowed, that the office being new, there was no
precedent to guide them; that the Municipal Act of 1882
had enacted that “for all purposes connected with the
right to vote at municipal elections, words in this Act
importing the masculine gender include women.” It was
allowed that the Local Government Acts of 1888 contain no
enactments against women.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Judge stated that it was a new office, but that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>woman had ever sat in a Municipal Corporation. That
Anne Clifford was a <i>solitary</i> instance of a woman being
Sheriff.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c023'><sup>[23]</sup></a> That it was necessary that a statute should give
express permission to women to be elected, because
Lord Brougham’s Act does not apply to this.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>See</i> “Ante,” pp. 43, 44.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Another Judge stated that his opinion would have
been in favour of the women’s claim, but for the 63rd
Section of the Act of 1888. But the majority of those
concerned, accepting the assertion “that a more learned
Judge never lived than Justice Willes,” who had checked
the Historical arguments in the case of Chorlton <i>v.</i> Lings,
accepted also the decision in that case as the grounds of
their Ruling. “I take it, that neither by the Common
Law nor the Constitution of this country, from the beginning
of the Common Law until now, can a woman be
entitled to exercise any public function.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One at least they forgot whom they might have remembered,
it was the Woman from whom they held
their Seals of office.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus Lady Sandhurst, after helping her colleagues,
her country and her sex, for a year, with two other brave
women were turned out, and the Council and the Country
were alike the sufferers thereby. “Who will take care
of the Baby Farms, the Pauper Lunatic women? the
many small details that a man cannot know by accident,
and prides himself in not knowing by experience?”</p>

<p class='c008'>If they have been defeated on the County Councils, the
success of women as Poor Law Guardians is undeniable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The spirit of tenderness for those who receive charity in
their old age, the healing spirit of sympathy for those
that have been tempted; the spirit of exact investigation
of accounts, and of economy in expending the ratepayers’
money, has certainly been fostered by the presence of
women on the Boards. The same may be said of
women on the School Boards. They have offered themselves
for many public appointments and offices. Sometimes
they are accepted gladly; sometimes they are only
not ejected because the law for doing so cannot be
found.</p>

<p class='c008'>A self-sacrificing worker in the cause of women has
collected together and tabulated all the elections a
woman may at present join, all the public offices she
may at present fill. “The elections at which women
may vote at present are: The House of Keyes, Isle of
Man; Town Councils in England, Scotland, and Belfast;
County Councils in England and Scotland, District
Councils in Scotland, School Boards, Boards of Guardians,
Local Boards of Health, Improvement Commissioners,
Waywardens and Highway Boards, Road Surveyors,
Burgh Commissioners in Scotland, Parochial Boards in
Scotland, Select Vestries and District Boards in London,
Burial Boards and Common Vestries.</p>

<p class='c008'>They can be elected to School Boards, Boards of
Guardians; also to Parochial Boards in Scotland and
many other boards. They can be elected now to very
many public offices, can be Members of Royal Commissions,
Visitors of Lunatic Asylums, Inspectors of the Poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in Scotland, Inspectors of Nuisances, Registrars of Births,
Deaths, and Marriages; Collectors of Poor Rates, Members
of Dispensary Boards, Road Surveyors, Overseers of the
Poor, Churchwardens, Sextons, Parish Clerks, Local
Government Board Inspectors, County Council Inspectors
of Baby Farms, Noxious Trades, etc.; Factory and
Workshop Inspectors under the Home Office, Post-mistresses
and Clerks in the Post Office, Census Clerks”
(<i>see</i> “The Civil Rights of Women,” by Mrs. Eva
Maclaren).</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of these duties are, of course, performed without
remuneration, but in others they are paid at a fair rate, in
some cases, at the same rate as men.</p>

<p class='c008'>I take in a separate paragraph some questions regarding
work and its returns, but it seems necessary first to show
the advance of education during the period. I have
always felt that our sex owes much to our Queen simply
for <i>being</i> what she is. At the time of the Reform Bill of
1832, she was being trained wisely for her future duties.
The intellectual powers of a girl, when educated under
favourable conditions, were brilliantly illustrated in her.
The young Queen succeeded in 1837, and from the commencement
of her reign there has been a constantly
expanding view of the educatability even of ordinary
girls. The want of good secondary schools was at first
severely felt; but women began to patch up their education
by private study or at public Lectures. The Philosophical
Institution of Edinburgh, providing Lectures,
Library, and Reading-Room, founded in 1846, was open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>from the first to women, as well as to men, and in many
a large town were similar opportunities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Thomas Oliphant of that city, in the same year,
started a large School in Charlotte Square, to which he
added two “Advanced Classes” for the elder girls.
There were taught Literature and Science in new and
suggestive methods, that many women, still living, have
rejoiced in. The Normal Schools for training Teachers
had always been open to women; but these “Advanced
Classes” were intended for women of leisure, those who
had been accustomed to leave a Ladies’ Finishing School,
to become the Butterflies of Ball-Rooms, or better-class
domestic drudges. A host of imitators showed the demand
for schools of Mr. Oliphant’s style.</p>

<p class='c008'>In London, the Public Day School Company, since
1871, has done splendid work, and trained thousands
of girls; and higher schools and colleges all over the
country, have given solid education to a class of young
women, to whom, formerly, the most superficial smattering
was considered sufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, the Secondary Education of women having
succeeded, the higher education was attempted. When
the University Local Examinations were commenced,
they were opened to girls as well as to boys, to women as
well as to men. They soon proved that they were able
to take advantage of their opportunities. Strong efforts
were made in many quarters to have them admitted to
the Universities on equal terms with men. Failing this,
there were strenuous attempts made to secure, at least, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>education, if not the other privileges of a University
career.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The earliest University Classes for Women</b> were opened
in Edinburgh in the winter of 1867-8, when 265 women
enrolled themselves as students in Professor Masson’s
class on English Literature alone. In 1868-9, three
branches of the Arts Curriculum were offered in Literature,
Natural Philosophy, and Logic and Mental Philosophy;
opportunities which spread until the whole field
was covered. In October, 1869, Hitchin Temporary
College was opened for women in similar connection with
Cambridge University. In 1873, the Oxford Association
for the Education of Women took shape. In 1876,
Glasgow and St. Andrews joined the work, and other
opportunities all over the country had to be arranged to
meet the ever-increasing demand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first University to grant degrees to women on
equal terms was London, in the new Charter of 1878.
As a non-teaching university, however, its gift of Degrees
was limited by the opportunities opened to women of
acquiring professional education in recognised colleges.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Royal University of Ireland in Dublin opened in
1880, and in its original Charter grants equal terms for
men and women; and the Victoria University in 1880,
allowing women instruction and examination in some
departments, granted Degrees where they had passed
sufficient examinations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1892, the Scotch Universities were opened simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Durham offered, under certain conditions, to admit
women, conditions not finally arranged, when it found by
its Charter that it could not do so. Education is, however,
granted women in the affiliated colleges of Newcastle,
and Titles, if not Degrees, allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cambridge admits women to its examinations, grants
them a recognised place, but no Degrees. Oxford
examines them, but also excludes them from full privileges. [<a href='#app-x'>x</a>].</p>

<p class='c008'>In none of these Universities can women, either as
Undergraduates or Graduates, vote for the University
Member of Parliament. The same anomaly exists as
existed in relation to a property qualification. The real
qualification in a University is based upon attending
certain classes, passing certain examinations, living under
certain conditions, and paying certain fees. Women fulfil
all these duties, but they do not, even from their Alma
Mater, receive the same privilege as their brothers, on a
University Qualification; because the Reform Bill of
1867, while granting it to all men on property qualification,
by clause 5, limited it to “male persons in Universities.”
It is possible that, after a little more of the
Higher Education, it will be found that they have attained
“an improved understanding,” enough to allow them
even to vote by the side of the navvy and the pot-boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The twenty-six years have not been lost, however, even
in regard to Women’s Suffrage. Meanwhile have been
growing up young men and young women, educated
under the broadening effect of more equal privileges in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>learning. The old restrictions seem to them meaningless
in the new light of reason. A generous youth, in
the older Universities, who has been beaten by a woman
in a mathematical examination, feels his brow flush when
he receives the reward that is denied to her, and feels
shame instead of pride that he has to be protected
against her competition. He would never dream of
suggesting that she would “require an improved understanding
to vote for a Parliament man.” In the youth
of the country lies hope, if the youth be but trained
aright.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of the educational opportunities has been
to give women personal capability of entering professional
life. But the Professions have certain powers of excluding
competitors, and they have all done what they could
to make entrance difficult or impossible. Women are
now admitted to the Medical Profession. Several
original professions they have invented for themselves,
and they have done their best with the old. They have
therefore gained new powers of acquiring property.
Their energy and self-dependence have revolutionised the
thoughts of men as regards their capability.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Stuart Mill, in his “Subjection of Women,”
p. 99, says: “If anything conclusive can be inferred
from experience, without psychological analysis, it would
be that the things women have not been allowed to do
are just those that they succeed best in doing.” Association
of ideas is doing its work in forming customs and in
moulding habits of thought. No longer is a woman an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>incongruous sight in Halls of Learning or of Research,
in Scientific Societies or on Boards of Guardians. Those
who exclude women are learning that they themselves
suffer by the exclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>They welcome them eagerly as Canvassers at elections.
Ere long they will find it both natural and desirable to
invite them to co-operate with them through the Ballot-box,
“to choose a Knight of the Shire or a Burgess from
a Borough, in the stead of all and of each of them, to go
to the Parliament House, and there consulting with the
Knights of other Shires,” to defend the interests of <i>those
who sent them</i>.</p>

    <div>“All sisters are <i>co-parceners</i> one with another. The elder-born has no privilege over the younger.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>If</span> in these pages I have not noted the great majority of
women who never have had, under any condition, any
privilege of any kind, it is not because I have forgotten
them. The needle-workers, whose toil is doubled and
whose pay is halved by self-enriching sweaters; the
labouring women, toiling in unfavourable conditions
alongside of men now privileged with voices powerful
enough to control their earnings; the tempted women,
whose temptations are made strong and dangerous for
them through false social and economic views; the poor
married women, who may be happy only according to
the degree that their husbands are better than the Law
allows them to be; the poor mother to whom Slave
Law is still applied in regard to their children. But the
principles of Method lead us to take one step at a time;
the doctrines of Logic prevent us confusing two ideas;
and the Precedents of the Law Courts teach us that
“where claims are improperly consolidated they cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>be heard” (<i>see</i> Bennet <i>v.</i> Bromfit, Queen’s Bench,
1868).</p>
<p class='c008'>To lose the possible reward of any effort by misplacing
it, is, to say the least of it, unwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men have placed all women in one class now. We
are all sisters, and “co-parceners” one with another.
They have extended political privileges to all, under
conditions very easy to fulfil, except to Aliens, Minors,
Lunatics, Criminals, and <i>Women</i>. The Aliens may
become naturalised, the Minors may attain majority,
Lunatics may regain their reason, and when a Criminal
has served his time he may become once more a free
British Elector. The noblest and the best, the most
learned and philanthropic of women, classed with the
worst, are reckoned as something lower than the lowest
Criminal. He may, combining with others of his class,
urge on his narrow, selfish views; they may not enrich
the world by advancing the high, generous ideals that
lie nearest their hearts. If any women, on any qualification,
become enfranchised, the disability of sex-in-itself
will be removed, and to all others thereby will be
given a ray of hope. It has seemed to me, through
following a Psychological study of the springs of human
action, that the class most likely to receive Enfranchisement
first, is that which formerly had it. Therefore I,
with others who would not be immediately concerned
in the success of our efforts, join hands in toil to help
forward the claims of those who have been British Freewomen,
as that section of the community which can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>claim most on Historical grounds and by Legal Precedents.
We hope that they, being given the chance,
will help their less fortunate sisters.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must not forget, that the very Charters, that have
so mightily multiplied the legions of <i>Freemen in Esse</i>,
have likewise increased the number of <i>Freewomen in
Posse</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the light increases, so that men can see to read
aright, then women may be able “to take up their
Freedom too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>M. Talleyrand Perigord,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c023'><sup>[24]</sup></a> once Bishop of Autun,
observes “that to see one half of the human race excluded
by the other, from all participation in Government,
is a political phenomenon that on abstract principles
it is impossible to explain.” We think the phenomenon
very capable of explanation, but the reason is to
be found, not in the perfection of human nature, but in its
incompleteness.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>See</i> Dedication of Mary
Wollstonecraft Godwin’s “Vindication of the Rights
of Women.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The Romance of the old world was carried on by
the “fair women and brave men,” little being said of
the <i>plain women</i> and the <i>weak men</i>. Civilisation has
advanced far enough to recognise the claims of the <i>weak
men</i>; we want it to go further, and help wisely the cause
of the <i>weak women</i>. For that we require, reversing the
adjectives, armies of “brave women and fair men,” <i>brave
women</i> who seek not their lost birthright with futile
tears, but with self-sacrificing energies, and heart-inspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>sympathies; and <i>fair men</i> who can understand that none
lose through another’s gain, and that theirs is not Liberty
but License, that use a self-asserted power to the restriction
of the rights and privileges of others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various tests have been proposed to mark different
degrees of Civilisation. I believe that the common-place
man of to-day might suggest that the multiplication
of Machinery is the most satisfactory index.
More thoughtful men would consider a recognition of
the first principles of Justice a safer ground. Some of
these assert that the position of women is the surest test
of the Civilisation of a Country and of a Time. If this be
so, Nineteenth Century men must look to their character
as posterity will judge it, for the Century is very near its
close. They are apt to be judged not by what they
have done, but by what they have left undone.</p>

<p class='c008'>In reality one cause of the existence of so much
statutory evil is this, that the majority of men are so
much better than the laws—they do not understand
their full bearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Victor Hugo has said, “Man was the problem of the
eighteenth century, Woman is the problem of the nineteenth.”
To understand and solve that problem, a
totally different set of reasonings must be applied than
have hitherto been used by the majority of men. The
so-called “Physical Force Argument” is, after all, but
the ghost of a Dead Argument raised to scare the timid
in the night. It can be valid only in Savage times, when
Might makes Right. It is inoperative in Civilisations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>where Justice even <i>pretends</i> to decide the rights of men.
Even under the “physical force argument,” some women
might be free. Many women are stronger than many
men; and many women have been known to signalise
that strength, not only in disguise as soldiers, or as
navvies, but openly fearless and free.[<a href='#app-ix'>ix</a>.] The courage
of Nicholaa de la Haye and Black Agnes of Dunbar; of
the Countess of Derby and the Marchioness of Hamilton
during the Civil War has been emulated by many others.
Some men assert scornfully that women are not fit for
privilege or power. To assert a thing is not to prove it.
If women are not fit for the Franchise, perhaps it may
be made fit for them. It is perfectly certain that they
are fitted to enjoy justice and to benefit by freedom.
Some sentimentalists say that women are too pliable and
delicate to be exposed to the roughnesses of political life.
It would destroy their charm. To such objectors I
would answer, Look out into the flat meadows where
sluggish streamlets wind, and see in the inartistic clumps
of pollard-willows an illustration of the manner in which
“woman’s nature” has been treated by such men.
Though their roots and leaves are the same, though
their upward aspirations are permanent, and their vital
energies restorative, yet through top-pruning at the will
of others, for the use of others, the growth and the
ideals of the trees have been marred for ever. Nothing
can ever restore to a Pollard-Willow its natural place in
the picture-gallery of trees. But its distortion has only
been individual, its offspring through freedom may develope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>into a perfect tree, really sweet and graceful, and
not artificially so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other sentimentalists say that women are angels, and
their purity must not be contaminated by contact with
the great outer world of vile realities. They mistake
fragile butterflies for God’s angels. These are spirits
strong in His strength, whose inward purity gives them
power to pass unscathed through external impurity, whose
sympathy gives them knowledge and whose presence
purifies and refines the moral atmosphere. The more a
woman is like an angel, the more is she needed to
counsel and to work with men.</p>

<p class='c008'>That women do not want it, is another futile objection.
No classes or masses ever unanimously want saving regeneration
of any kind, until the few have made it seem
desirable to them. We know that at least a quarter of a
million women in this country do want it, and have
set their hands to the present great “Appeal to the
Members of Parliament” to grant them political freedom
for weighty reasons. To refuse that quarter million what
the other millions do not ask, is like refusing to the
Eagle and the Lark the right to fly, because the Ostrich
and the Swan do not care for the exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Others boldly say that this is a man’s world, and in it
men must rule. It is true that man has long led in the
Song of Life, with words and music written at his will,
and woman has but played an Accompaniment. Sometimes
in their Duets she has been forced to sing a shrill
second, or a piping Bass, in notes that have no meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>when they are sung alone. But he did not see or hear,
and she dared not say, that this was not the sole part
that she could sing or play. In the many-voiced Concert
of the Universe, where harmonious “parts” should combine
in balanced perfection, there are constant discords
and recurrent “clangs,” because man has misunderstood
the Rules of Harmony. The Bass voices are necessary
for perfection, but too much Bass becomes monotonous
to the listening ear, and overpowering the finer notes,
spoils the Conception of the Whole. If there is anything
in this Analogy, it is the Woman’s voice that should lead
the Melody and express the meaning, and the man’s voice
should support her notes and enrich the Harmony. One
need not analyse the various other objections. None of
them are based on Truth, Justice, Logic, or History.</p>

<p class='c008'>In my second Chapter I spoke somewhat of women’s
privilege as heiresses, but I would like here to add a few
words about unprivileged earners.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Labour is the Basis of Property.</b>—I do not wish now
to analyse all the Economic Theories regarding the relations
of Property to Labour, but only the one that
touches our question. In olden times Labour was paid
in kind. Money is an arbitrary sign of labour, as speech
is of thought. Money is an easy medium by which
the returns of labour can be transferred, either in purchase
of other property or of other labour, or as a free gift or
inheritance.</p>

<p class='c008'>In ancient times fighting was considered a kind of
labour, the highest kind. The Service of the King was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the most honourable, save that of the Service of the
Church. Fighting and praying were alike paid in land,
or in coin, and the land or the coin could be inherited
by those who neither fought nor prayed. Hard-working
traders and farmers also earned coin and land, and sometimes
left their gains to idle children. Hence owners
have not always been earners. Some writers on National
Economy have inveighed against the principle of inheritance.
To me it seems natural and right that what a
man has produced by labour, he may leave to his
descendants, at least, when he does so by old Saxon
Law. There has been much virulent denunciation of
Landlords, especially in relation to the <i>unearned increment
of property</i> in thriving towns. I do not know any
however, who have discussed a question, that bears
much upon the Argument of this book.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>The Unrecorded Increment of Woman’s Labour.</b>—Earners
are not always owners. Except where a woman
brought some fortune at her marriage it has been supposed
that her husband “supported her.” But in the
majority of respectable middle-class or workmen’s dwellings,
this is very far from being the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman labours as well as her husband. If property
is the result of labour, both can be expressed in
figures. Let us take a man earning 30s. a week for eight
hours’ work a day, and five hours on Saturday, forty-five
in all. The payment for each hour is 8d. As the
woman spends no time walking to and from her work;
as she has no rest on Saturdays or Sundays except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>through extra work on other days; as she on these other
days works very many more hours than her husband, she
has bettered the common stock by the amount of ninety
hours of work; which taken at half the wage, rises to
the same sum, so that the common income should be
reckoned at 60s. instead of 30s. But her share being
received in kind, it is unrecognised and unrecorded.
This may be made clear by supposing that some other
person had fulfilled the wife’s duties. In transferring
flour into bread she earns what the baker otherwise
would gain in the difference between flour and the price
of the loaf. In washing and ironing the family linen she
earns what the laundress would charge for the same,
minus the cost of soap and coals. In carrying a heavy
basket from the distant stores, she earns what the local
grocer would have done in the difference between wholesale
and retail prices; in making clothes for her children
out of her own frayed garments, she earns what the
draper would have charged for similar material, and what
the dressmaker would have required for making it up.
If she patches her husband’s clothes, she earns the
tailor’s charge. Her daily scrubbing and cooking may
be reckoned at charwoman’s wages, and thus, multiplied
by the hours of labour, the proportion may come out.
Both she and her husband dimly feel that she has saved
expenditure, they never realise that she has acquired
property.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spending also must be reckoned. The result
of the man’s labour has been translated into coin, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>more convenient form in which to pay rent and taxes,
the Club-money and direct Shop-purchases for both. Of
the common diet the man has the larger and better
share. Beyond this he generally has a daily paper, a
pipe, and beer. At the lowest estimation these cost
3s. 6d. a week. If he has no vices, there may be 3s. in
his pocket at the end of the week, and that 3s. may be
put into a Savings Bank in his name, which after years
of saving, <i>by modern</i> law, he may will away from his
wife and children.</p>

<p class='c008'>What of her toil, her earnings, her increment of property?
It has seemed to vanish, but it has really enriched
him. This may easily be seen if, leaving her
domestic employments, she goes out to labour as charwoman
in the house of others at 2s. 6d. a day of ten
hours. She there also receives food. The position then
is this. The common house-property is increased by the
expenditure on her food being saved. She still saves
somewhat to the family in comfort and money by working
overtime. Her husband has either to do without
some of his comforts or her economies, or spend some
hours of his relaxation in home-work. But at the end
of the week, there is the visible increment of fifteen
shillings. Before 1870 all that belonged legally to the
husband, since that time it belongs nominally to the
wife. That is the meaning of the Married Women’s
Property Bill. A husband should support a wife, but
the money she earns she may keep to herself. But it is
hard on wives and mothers that their share in the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>property should be unrecognised when their toil is
continued under the ordinary domestic conditions; but be
recognised when circumstances or inclination make it possible
for them to seek a visible money reward elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>We will take another example from a higher rank.
Suppose a man has £300 a year, and is left a widower
with four young children, he at once feels the diminution
of his income, through the increase of his needs. He
must have a housekeeper, at a salary, at least, of £25.
Her keep costs him another £30. He must find a daily
governess to teach the children, and walk with them.
Without keep that may cost another £25. He has to pay
the dressmaker for making and repairing the children’s
clothes, at least £10. He has to pay workmen to hang
pictures, put up curtains, to paint the back-garden fence,
or enamel the nursery bath; to cover the drawing-room
chairs, or patch the dining-room sofa, quite £10 a year.
His wife’s whole keep had been saved through greater care
in purchasing and managing food, and higher skill in cooking
than either his housekeeper or assistant-girl possesses;
and the man has not only lost the love and comfort of
his wife, but the £100 a year which she indirectly earned
for him. He thought his income was £300 and was all
his own; he finds it had been really £400, as compared
to the present receipts of expenditure, and that the missing
£100 had been earned by her. He would have
found this out had he allowed her to give music-lessons
as she wished to do, a light labour that she loved. Or
she might have written that weekly letter to the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>paper she was asked to do. She might have earned
£100 a year at that, and that money would have been
<i>her own</i> to spend in luxury or charity if she pleased, or to
have saved up for her children’s future. But then his
tradesmen’s bills would have been increased. It is absurd,
therefore, to believe that a wife’s earnings are
limited to those hours that she takes from her husband’s
service and sells to some other employer of labour, who
pays her in so much coin of the realm.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the <i>partner</i> that touches the coin seems always to
take the lead. We may see this in the circumstances
where the positions are altered, as, for instance, among
many fishing communities. There, though the men go
out at night and fish, the women not only do their
domestic work, but receive the fish, go out and sell it,
make the necessary purchases, and “bank” the remainder
of the money. The superior intelligence and
relative social position of the women in fishing communities
has often been noted. I have heard it scornfully
said of a fisher-girl, “She marry? Why, she is not able
to keep a man!” In this illustrative case, the woman
holds the purse, and her share in the family earnings is
recognised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, if privilege is based on property, and property is
based on labour, how is an industrious woman shut out
from the benefits of both? Why must the man only have
the earner’s vote? One vivifying revelation of our half-century
is the recognition of the nobility of labour. No
one has so gracefully expressed it as Mrs. Barret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Browning in “Aurora Leigh,” when, urging all to work,
she adds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Get leave to work;</div>
      <div class='line'>In this world ’tis the best you get at all,</div>
      <div class='line'>For God in cursing, gives us better gifts</div>
      <div class='line'>Than man in benediction.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But even with her it was too much work for its own
sake. It has taken fuller education, even since her time,
for women to recognise that it is equally noble and just
for them to receive the reward of toil in earning as it is
for a man; and to be able to keep or use these earnings
as they will. A century ago, men suffered somewhat
from the state of things they had themselves initiated.
An eldest son that received all the inheritance and privilege
had therewith to support the women of his father’s
family as well as of his own. It was disgraceful for
him as well as for them that they should <i>earn money</i>.
But they gave him labour, acting as upper servants,
butts of ridicule, as the case might be, or blind worshippers
when all the outer world had learned to disbelieve
in him. Their recreation was the manufacture of
useless Berlin-wool monstrosities; or self-sacrificing work
in pauperising the poor of the parish, under the misdirection
of a callow curate. Higher education was discredited;
literary aspiration a shame-faced secret. Miss
Austen had to hide her pen and ink and manuscripts by
a piece of fancy-work kept handy, lest her world should
know and speak its mind of her and her dreadful doings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The only profession open to a lady was matrimony; and
the chances of happy matrimony were thereby enormously
decreased.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the dignity of being able to earn money has raised
women immensely in social life, their higher education
has made this earning possible. Dependent sisters
need no longer hang their heads in shame before supporting
brothers. If they are not needed in their homes,
they may go forth into the world, eat the sweet bread of
honest labour, and become individuals.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the woman is fettered still by the trammels of
custom, by the protection accorded to males; false social
and economic creeds which teach that man’s work must
be paid higher than woman’s, whether it is better done
or not; by men’s power of place, which gives them power
of veto; by inherited thought-fallacies and linguistic inaccuracies;
by the nature of the medium through which
things are seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bacon wisely advised men to study all things in the
“lumen siccum” or dry light of science, lest vapours
arising from the mind should obscure the vision. He
also pointed out that “There are four classes of Idols
which beset men’s minds. To these for distinction sake
I have assigned names—calling the first class Idols of
the Tribe; the second, Idols of the Cave; the third,
Idols of the Market-place; the fourth, Idols of the
Theatre” (“Novum Organum,” Article xxxix., p. 53; also
in lix.). “But the Idols of the Market-place are the most
troublesome of all; idols which have crept into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>understanding through the alliances of words and names.
For men believe that their reason governs words; but it
is also true that words react on the understanding.”
Is the word “man” a common or masculine term?</p>

<p class='c008'>After an impartial analysis of the laws regarding
women, can men say that they are just? Can they continue
to assert that they know better than women do what
they need, and wish, and strain after; and if they know,
will they <i>do</i> the thing that is necessary? With the best will
in the world, which I believe the majority of men have,
they do not know how. Only the foot that wears the
shoe knows just where it pinches, and feels keenly the
need of alteration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why must a woman be unable to free herself from an
unfaithful husband if his hand is restrained from personal
cruelty?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why may a noble and loving mother have less power
over the children she bore, and toiled for, than a selfish,
indifferent father, who still “has sacred rights, because
he has sacred duties” that he has despised?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why must strong men inherit their father’s unwilled
property before weak women?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why must a bad workman be paid higher wages than
a good workwoman?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why are all laws in regard to vice notoriously unequal?</p>

<p class='c008'>Why have labouring men the right injuriously to
determine the conditions and opportunities of the labour
of women working by their side?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>It is because men are represented in Parliament and
women are not.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The House of Commons is as sensitive to the claims
of the Represented as the mercury is to the weather.”
If women, oppressed by various burdens, wish their will
should reach the House, they must be given a voice.
The only method by which the needs and wishes of
women can be considered duly is by classing them once
more among the “represented.” In vain otherwise will
they look to their friends in the House to help various
Bills they desire to pass, or to restrain other Bills they
desire not to pass. It is not their friends they require
to affect, it is their opponents. And their opponents can
only be converted to the woman’s cause when women
become Electors. That Bills affecting the liberties of
more than half of the whole population should be left in
the hands of “private members,” that they should be left
to the chance of a private members’ ballot, that a
Machinery Bill, or any other Bill affecting the interests
of the smallest class of Electors, should be allowed to
“talk out” the limited time allowed for the discussion of
a question of such magnitude, shows the peculiar and
sinister aspect in which Bills affecting the “unrepresented”
can be viewed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Archimedes of old said that he could move the world
if he had but a “place where to stand.” If women want
to move their world, to affect its destinies and their own,
they too must have a place where to stand, and the place
where to stand is the Suffrage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“I trust the suffrage will be extended on good old
English principles, and in conformity with good old
English notions of representation” (“Essay on the Constitution,”
by Lord Russell).</p>

<p class='c008'>What these were I have attempted to show.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apart from the special measures urgently needed on
behalf of women, most public measures affect them
equally with men.</p>

<p class='c008'>A woman grocer is as much interested in Sugar Bounties
and in Tea-taxes as her male rivals.</p>

<p class='c008'>A woman housekeeper needs as much to be protected
against the imposition of frozen home or foreign meat, at
fresh English prices, as does the burdened British farmer.</p>

<p class='c008'>All women suffer as much in War, and gain as much
by Peace as men do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Noxious trades, impure air, bad drainage, poison women
as they do men. Women have as much interest in the
character and wisdom of the members of the house as men
have, because they also suffer from the consequences of
their unwise actions. How, therefore, can anyone say—these
things do not concern women?</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be better for men too, if women were represented.
They would then understand the meaning of
Justice, and enjoy the return blessings of fair-play. They
would discover that in the very difference of women lies
one great argument for their being consulted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If public-spirited women continue to be denied the
power of offering their judgment in the consensus of
public opinion on political matters, the nation will be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>poorer. It will ere long recognise this. But it does not
yet.</p>

<p class='c008'>How can any Assembly be said to be “Representative
of the People,” when the best half of the People are not
represented there; the best half in numbers, through
the working out of the modern doctrine of the Survival
of the Fittest; the best half by Statistics, as there are
five times as many male criminals as female; the best
half, by the position in which God placed woman at the
Creation, at the Fall, and the Redemption. If it starts
under false pretences how can it do the best possible to
itself?</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a strange suggestive duality even in our
physical frame. We have two eyes, two ears, two hands,
two feet, many other dualities, and two lobes of the
brain to control them. If by any cause one lobe of the
brain is injured, it is the <i>other side</i> of the body that
becomes paralysed, but the whole body suffers with its
members. If men persist in using only one eye, they
not only see things out of focus, but restrict their range
of vision. They can only see things on the near side
of them. A Government that only uses the masculine
eye, and sees but the masculine side of things, is at best
but a <i>one-eyed</i> Government. The builder that only
toils with one hand impoverishes himself, and makes
meaner the design of the great Architect. The traveller
that through some brain-sick fancy imagines one of his
feet to be decrepit, can get along but by hops and jerks,
or by using crutches made of dead wood, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>living limbs that make motion graceful, equal, and rapid.
Yet thus men do, wondering, meanwhile, that the “times
are out of joint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Let them apply reason to their time-worn aphorisms,
and the scales of justice to their out-worn Customs. Let
them look at Humanity as it is, and as it ought to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two comparisons will help them in the review, their
comparison with their ancestors in this respect, and their
comparison with “the perfect man in Christ Jesus,” and
his “perfect Law of Liberty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For Revelation has enriched our education. Through
much misconstruction and misconception the vision of
Creation has been coloured by the prejudice of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>God made man in His own image, male and female;
man has made him altogether male. The Creator said,
“It is not good for man to be alone.” His creature
asserts, “It is best for us to be alone.” But it never has
been good; it is not good now. Only in following out
the lines of God’s conception can <i>man</i> (<i>homo</i>) remain in
the image of God. Early names were all connotative,
recording some special quality or association, and the
early name of Adam was “Dust,” and the meaning of
Eve is “Life.” The Titanic and Earth-born Physical
force of which Adam was made the representative, must
be united to that which <i>lives and brings Life</i>, to make one
perfect being. Only through the spiritual and practical
union of Man with Woman can society be regenerated.
When Woman ate of the Tree of the knowledge of Good and
Evil, she learned more clearly to distinguish the good from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the evil and to choose that good. Therefore, God chose
the Woman as His fellow-worker in the scheme of Redemption.
As part of the curse of Satan it is part of the
primeval blessing of Humanity, that “I will put enmity
between thee and the Woman.” The hands that restrict
the Woman’s power, and limit her opportunity of fulfilling
her mission, are fighting against God’s Will.</p>

<p class='c008'>The words of God, “Thy desire shall be unto thy
husband, and he shall rule over thee,” is a prophecy
of man’s wrong and not a statute of man’s right. To
understand this we have only to collate the passage with
that other in which God speaks to Cain before he slew
his brother—“If thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted, and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door.
And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule
over him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of the first “physical force argument”
was the death of the “righteous Abel.” The result of
the same argument, through centuries of human existence,
has been the death-in-life of the Woman whom God opposed
to Satan. And the paralysis of the half has
affected the whole body Social and Politic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Divine and Human are united through the
Woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only by the representative Woman that Christ
becomes the “Son of Man.” <a href='#app-i'>i</a></p>

<p class='c008'>Christ, as His Father did, took women to be His
friends and fellow-workers. Women never forsook Him.
Woman watched by His cradle and spread the “glad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>tidings” ere yet He had opened His lips. Fearless
women stood by His Cross and saw the last of His
life; faithful women went to the Tomb and learned first
of His Resurrection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the ages, the contest between Satan and the
Woman and between the Seed of Satan and the Seed
of the Woman, has been made unduly hard both for
Man and Woman, because of the Woman being bound
both hand and foot. “The Dragon was wroth with the
Woman and went to make war with the Remnant of her
Seed which keep the Commandments of God, and have
the Testimony of Jesus Christ” (Rev. xii. 17).</p>

<p class='c008'>Let her have Freedom and Fair Play. Let her show
what, God helping her, she can do, when men cease
hindering her in the development of <i>Herself</i>. They also
will be gainers thereby. It will seem a new Creation
when the earlier-born <i>Freeman</i> meets the later-born <i>Freewoman</i>
and recognises at last that it was not good for him
to have been so long alone. For any Moral Regeneration,
or for any Political Stability, men must learn to distinguish
Good from Evil, Justice from short-sighted Selfishness,
and to see, in the recognition of Woman as a help-meet
for them <i>in all things</i>, the fulfilment of God’s Will in
regard to both.</p>

<p class='c033'><a id='app-i'></a>[i.—“Eldest daughters,” page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>.] This custom was not clear
among the Normans. In one well-known case at least, the younger
sisters were made Abbesses or otherwise disposed of, and the eldest
made by the Norman law sole heir. Mabile, eldest daughter of
Robert Fitzhaymo, was heir of all his lands, and King Henry I.
wished to marry her to his illegitimate son Robert. This she long
withstood, giving as her reason that she would not have a man for
her husband that had not two names. When the King remedied
that by calling his son Fitz Roy, she said, “That is a fair name as
long as he shall live, but what of his son and his descendants?”
The King then offered to make him Earl of Gloucester. “Sir,”
quoth the maiden, “then I like this well; on these terms I consent
that all my lands shall be his” (Robert of Gloucester’s “Brut,”
and Seyers’ “Memoirs of Bristol,” p. 353).]</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='app-ii'></a>[ii.—“The Countess Lucy,” page <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>.] It is accepted that Anglo-Saxon
Earls had only official dignity which was not hereditary.
But the inheritance of the lands generally carried the other privileges.
Lucy was certainly made Countess of Chester by her third husband,
but in some authorities she is entitled Countess of Bolingbroke, as
in her own right. In Selby’s “Genealogist,” 1889, there is a long
discussion on the point, Who was the Countess Lucy? She is
ordinarily considered the grand-daughter of Leofric, Earl of Mercia
(who died in 1057), and of his wife the famous Lady Godiva, who
survived the Conquest. Their son Alfgar, Earl of Mercia, twice
rebelled against the Confessor, and died in 1059. Lucy’s two
brothers were Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria;
her sister Edgiva married first, Griffith of Wales, and
second, King Harold. Edwin and Morcar were almost the only
English nobles permitted by the Conqueror to retain their lands.
Lucy inherited much from her father, probably with the Saxon
privilege of the “youngest born,” and afterwards more from her
brothers. She married three Norman husbands, with whom she
held the position of a great heiress. This is the view Dugdale takes.
Others imagine, from her longevity, there must have been two
Lucys. The writer in “The Genealogist” thinks, with good reason,
that this Lucy was not the daughter of Alfgar, but the only daughter
and heiress of Thorold, the Sheriff of Lincoln.]</p>

Essex, he gave the first specimen of that objurgatory and coarse
style, which makes his oratory so painfully remembered.” He also tells
about his unhappy second marriage, and its ominous opening. In the
Trials for the Murder of Sir Thomas Overburg, Foss says, “Guilty, as
the parties undoubtedly were, Coke conducted the Trial most unfairly.”
In regard to the suspicions attending the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>death of Prince Henry, Sir Anthony Weldon records—“It was
intended the Law should run in its proper channel, but was stopt
and put out of its course, by the folly of that great Clerke, though
no wise man, Sir Edward Coke” (“The Court and Character of King
James”). Sir E. Conway writes in 1624—“Sir Edward Coke would
die, if he could not help to ruin a great man once in seven years.”
“Butler notices that Coke had not studied the Feudal Law” (“Dict.
Nat. Biog.”). This may account for his ignorance of the powers of
women. “The Lord Coke in his Preface to Littleton, thinks
Littleton’s Tenures were first printed in 24 Hen. VIII; my Lord
was <i>mistaken</i>” (J. Anstiss Nicholl’s “Illustrations of Literature”).</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1620 Coke was intrusted with the drawing up of the Charge
against Bacon. Macaulay says, “For the first time in his life, he

up also the plea of disfranchisement for women.]</p>

the people, have always been open to women as well as to men. But
the relations of women to Universities, where they suffer, or have
suffered disabilities on the ground of their sex alone, are anomalous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The younger Universities are generally more liberal to women
than the older ones. Yet there is no universal rule, based upon
observable conditions. The general uncertainty makes the position
of things as they are, worth noting. Taking the Universities, not
in the chronological order of their foundation, but in the order of
their opening to women, the oldest is the London University. It
may be considered as a foundation either old or young. In 1548,
Sir Thomas Gresham founded in London, chairs for Divinity, Music,
Astronomy, Geometry, Law, Physic and Rhetoric, a liberal course
for his days. In Stow’s “Annals,” 1615, there is a notice of “the
three famous Universities of <i>Oxford, Cambridge and London</i>.” I
do not now go into its claims to the title at that period.</p>

<p class='c008'>On 19th August, 1835, the Duke of Somerset and others petitioned
for a Charter for London University, and in November of that year
the words were added to their claim—“It should always be kept
in mind that what is sought on the present occasion is an equality in
all respects with the ancient Universities, freed from those exclusions
and religious distinctions which abridge the usefulness of Cambridge
and Oxford.” Their demand was granted, and London University
refounded, but it was only men who were “freed from those exclusions.”
Its first Charter was formally renewed in the beginning
of the present reign, and a supplementary Charter in 1850 permitted
it to affiliate certain Colleges, but later on, its duty became limited
to <i>Examination</i>. The actual Charter by which it is now governed
is that of January 6th, 1863. In 1807 another Charter conferred
upon the University the power of instituting special examinations for
women. In the same year the Reform Act gave the graduates the
right to send one Representative member to Parliament. The Examinations
for Women did not thrive. It was found they did not
want a system devised exclusively for their use. After much discussion,
the Senate and Convocation agreed to accept from the
Crown in 1878 a supplemental Charter, making every Degree,
Honour, and Prize awarded by the University, accessible to both
sexes on perfectly equal terms. The University of London was
thus the first Academic body in the United Kingdom to admit women
as Candidates for Degrees. This supplement decrees that “5. All
the powers and provisions relating to the granting of Degrees and
Certificates of Proficiency contained in our said recited Letters Patent
of the 6th day of January in the 26th of our reign shall henceforward be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>read and construed as applying to women as well as to men, and
that, except as hereinafter mentioned, all the parts of the same Letters
Patent shall be read and construed as if the extended powers hereby
conferred were contained in the same Letters Patent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“6. And further, know ye that we do in like manner will and ordain
that notwithstanding anything in our said Letters Patent of the
sixth day of January in the twenty-sixth year of our reign to the
contrary, no Female Graduate of the said University shall be a member
of the Convocation of the said University unless and until such
Convocation shall have passed a resolution that Female Graduates
be admitted to Convocation.” Later, Convocation did pass that
resolution. Women are now admitted to their general Council.
The recording of their vote for their member of Parliament
depends on other decisions. “The Visitor,” is a woman, our
Queen. Therefore women cannot complain much of London
University. There, they have had a fair field and no favour. The
records of the results can be followed in the University Calendars.
Women have attained a very good position, and many honours in
proportion to the relative number of their candidates.</p>

<p class='c008'>As London University grants degrees to all capable persons
whether educated in Academic haunts or private homes, there are no
Colleges that can be said to be “affiliated.” But there are several
Colleges that prepare students definitely for the London Examinations.
Chief of these is University College, London. There, since
the opening of London University, women have been freely admitted
to all the instruction in the Science and Arts Classes, with
their prizes and honours. They require the recommendation of the
Lady Principal (Miss Morison) before admission as students, but
that can be easily attained by those really desirous of attending the
classes. Wives and daughters of Members of Senate or former
Members of Senate are admitted free, and without recommendation
in the same manner as are sons of the same gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The medical classes are, however, still closed, and women have to be
trained in Medicine in their own Medical School in 30 Handel Street,
whence they can take London Degrees. During the past year 143
women students attended the College, and 14 have been registered as
full medical practitioners. Admission to the legal practice of
Medicine is regulated by the General Medical Council of Great Britain
and Ireland in accordance with the powers conferred by Act of Parliament
upon that body, under whom are 20 examining boards.
Women educated in this school are eligible also to the exams. of the
Society of Apothecaries, London, and to other examinations in other
University centres. The British Medical Association is now opened
to them. King’s College, Strand, admits women, but they are
kept apart. What is called “The Ladies’ Department” is at 13
Kensington Square, a thriving centre. They can there prepare for
London University Exams.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The Mason College founded in Birmingham by Sir Joshua Mason,
Knt., 23rd February, 1875, opened by Prof. Huxley, in 1880, admits
men and women on the same terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aberystwyth University College of North Wales was opened in
1871, and there were women students in the musical department in
its early years. The first woman admitted to full College Course
was one who took an Exhibition of £15 in 1884. There was no
mention of sex in the Charter of the College, and therefore she only
asked admission, and was received. The number of women
students gradually increased, and after various attempts, a Hostel
was founded for their reception, and residence made compulsory for
all students not living with parents or guardians. A rapid increase
ensued in the number of women students, under the wise care of
Miss Carpenter, and they now number over 120. All prizes, the
“open” scholarships, are free to women, as well as the Associateship
of the College. In the London exams. the Aberystwyth women
students have done well. Other Welsh Colleges receive women.
This year the united Colleges of Wales have applied for a University
Charter, and the Professorships, as well as Studentships, are
opened to women.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot go into full details of all the Colleges that send up
women students to London University Examinations.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>Dublin University, founded in 1591, was incorporated in 1593, and
other colleges were afterwards affiliated. In 1869, women were admitted
to Queen’s College Examinations.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Charter of the Royal University of Ireland in 1880, decided
that “all Degrees, Honours, Exhibitions, Prizes and Scholarships
in this University are open to students of either sex.” The Royal
University of Ireland, absorbing the old Queen’s University, the
offices and emoluments of the one University merely passed on to
the other, with fuller powers and wider scope. It is now also an
examining body as is London.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the commencement of the Royal University, many qualified
women students attained the degrees thereby thrown open to them.
Since that time 665 women have been granted B.A. degrees, 90
M.A., 22 LL.D., and 20 LL.B. The old Queen’s Colleges of
Belfast, Cork, Galway and others, prepare students for the Royal
University, private students having, however, the same privileges.</p>

<p class='c008'>As all prizes and exhibitions are said to be open to all matriculated
students of the Colleges, some time ago Miss Lee (daughter
of the Late Archdeacon Lee of Dublin), now Principal of the Old
Hall at Newnham College, was proposed for a Fellowship. She
only gained 4 votes, one being that of Archbishop Trench; but the
fact of her being proposed and voted for at all, showed that her sex
did not exclude her from competition. The Act under which the
Royal University was founded, excludes women from Convocation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>unless they were members of the Senate. Convocation at present
consists of the Senate, and of qualified male Graduates. The Senate,
however, at first appointed by the Queen, consists of 36
Senators and one Chancellor, and except 6 Graduates, afterwards
elected by Convocation, it does not exclude women. The word
used in the Charter is invariably “person.”</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>The Royal Charter of the Victoria University is dated 20th April,
1880, which incorporates Owen’s College, Manchester; University
College, Liverpool; and Yorkshire College, Leeds, with freedom to
admit other Colleges. It makes no distinction of sex. It says:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“IV. The University shall have power to grant and confer all
such degrees and other distinctions as now or at any time hereafter
can be granted and conferred by any other University in our United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to and on all persons, male or
female, who shall have pursued a regular course of Study in a College
in the University and shall submit themselves for Examination.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicine and Surgery degrees are here excepted. The supplemental
Charter of 20th March, 1893, however, ordains:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I. The Victoria University shall have power to grant and confer
to and on all persons, whether male or female ... Degrees and
Certificates of Proficiency in Medicine and Surgery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Medical Degrees are therefore theoretically open to women.
But the characteristic of the Victoria University is, that it examines
those only who have gone through a course of study in each subject
of examination in a College of the University, and the privileges
of the University depend upon the arrangements made at the
Colleges. The Medical Schools at all three Colleges are still
closed to women, and therefore the Victoria University medical
degrees are practically dependent on extraneous teaching. If
women want a medical degree “they must study for two years, in
one of the affiliated Colleges, and take their medical classes at a
recognised school such as Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, or the
Medical School for Women, Edinburgh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Women were admitted to some classes in Owen’s College,
Manchester, in 1876. All the Science and Arts classes are now
open, but Biology, and some of the Laboratories are closed. In the
junior classes men and women are taught separately, though the examinations
are the same. The Department for Women of Owen’s
College, Manchester, is at 223 Brunswick Street.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the two younger colleges of Liverpool and Leeds; all Classes
and Laboratories are open to women, except in the Medical School.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fair proportion of women’s names appear in the Degree Lists
and in the Prize Lists. Several women are members of Convocation,
and there will soon be more. Many of them are Associates of
their College. Besides full Degrees, there are Certificates of Proficiency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>granted by this University to women. All <i>University</i> prizes
are open to women, and the majority of College Prizes.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>Edinburgh University was founded in 1582 on the site of the lonely
Kirk of Field, where Darnley met his death. The present building,
however, now called the Old University, was only begun in 1739. It
is to this College alone that women are as yet admitted. The University
New Buildings, commenced in 1878, were partly opened for teaching
purposes in 1880, and completed in 1888. This has been handed
over to the great “School of Medicine,” of Edinburgh University.
The McEwan Hall for public Academic Ceremonials and for the
conferring of Degrees was completed the year before last, and some
women graced its first public function.</p>

<p class='c008'>Edinburgh retains the honour of having been the earliest place in
the British Islands where women were admitted to the advantages
of a University education. Mrs. Crudelius in 1866 conceived the
idea, and with an ever-increasing army of sympathisers, she formed
in 1867 the “Edinburgh Association for the Higher Education of
Women,” afterwards entitled the “Edinburgh Association for the
University Education of Women.” This did good work. In the
session 1867-8 a class was opened in a separate hall, in which
Professor Masson delivered his University Lectures on English
Literature, 265 women enrolling themselves as students. Encouraged
by their success, in November, 1868, a second winter session,
the Association arranged for three classes in three departments, “the
Literary,” represented by Professor Masson’s on English Literature,
in which 129 women appeared; “the Scientific,” represented by
Professor Tait’s class of Experimental Physics, in which 141 women
entered; and “the Philosophical,” represented by Professor Fraser’s
Lectures on Logic and Psychology, the first time such a course had
been offered to women, and 65 women took advantage of it. The
quality of the work done both in Examinations and Essays, showed
that Intellect was of no Sex. The Association worked on patiently
through the years, more and more gaining the sympathy and
co-operation of the University, which soon granted Certificates for
proficiency in any three subjects, proved in examinations of the
M.A. Standard, the first of which was gained in 1873. Separate
Honours Examinations were also instituted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, a higher Certificate, called a Diploma, was offered to those
who had passed in seven subjects of M.A. Standard, one at least
in Honours. The first was gained in 1875, before any other Scottish
University had considered the needs of women, and before London
or Dublin had opened their doors. The disturbances made against
the attempts by women to gain admission to the medical school, had
made it more difficult for the Association to gain what it desired,
the opening of the Art Classes and Degrees to women. But it lived
to make warm friends among members of the University Senate who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>were at first its foes. The Scottish Universities Bill coming into
force the year before last, empowered the several Scotch Universities
to open their doors to women in their own time and in their own
way. Women students were to matriculate under the same conditions
as men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ordinance 18. IX.</p>

<p class='c008'>“1. It shall be in the power of the University Court of each
University to admit women to graduation in such Faculty or Faculties
as the said court may think fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“2. It shall be competent to the University Court of each
University to make provision within the University for the instruction
of women in any of the subjects taught by the University either
by admitting them to the ordinary classes, or by instituting separate
classes for their instruction. Such classes shall be conducted by the
Professors in the several subjects, or by Lecturers specially appointed
for the purpose by the University Court, provided always that the
Court shall not institute classes where men and women shall be
taught together, except after consultation with the Senatus, and
provided also that no Professor whose commission is dated before
the approval of this ordinance by Her Majesty in council shall be
required, without his consent, to conduct classes to which women
are admitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“3. The conditions for graduation within any Faculty in which
women are admitted to graduation shall be the same for women as
for men, with the exceptions,” that there are advantages offered at
present to women which may be classified under the name of Retrospective
Recognition. “So long as provision is not made for the
education of women in any University, qualifications gained at
other recognised centres will be accepted as preparing for examinations
and degrees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“4. So long as provision is not made for the education of women
in Medicine, the University is empowered to admit to graduation
women trained at other home or foreign Universities. So soon as,
within any of the said Faculties in any University, provision is made
for the instruction of women in all subjects qualifying for graduation,
... the conditions for the graduation of women within such Faculty
shall be the same as the conditions for the graduation of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“5. Women who had begun their studies in recognised University
classes before this date to be admitted to graduation, as if
they had been members of the University and, if they had passed in
the specified seven subjects qualifying for M.A., to receive that
degree without further examination.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of this concession is that eight ladies received the
degree of M.A. of Edinburgh University, and several more will be
qualified through the next Examination. Those who take their
Degree will be admitted to the General Council. Therefore, Edinburgh
stands at the head of the Scotch Universities in the order of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>time of the admission of women. She will have several women
graduates before any other University can present one. That, of
course, was only made possible by her efforts commencing earlier,
and her work being more systematic. One hundred and thirty-four
women in all have taken at least three of the subjects towards their
Degree Examination. Edinburgh has simply admitted women to
mixed Classes in the Old University, with all privileges in Arts.
About one hundred and twenty women have matriculated this
session. A Hall of Residence is now being built for women, to be
called the Masson Hall, in commemoration of the life-long devotion
of Professor David Masson to the cause of Women.</p>

<p class='c008'>The New University Building, the School of Medicine, is still
closed. But women have now fuller opportunities granted them of
studying in the “Medical College for Women,” 30 Chambers
Street, Edinburgh, with liberty of clinical instruction in the Royal
Infirmary. This College was founded by the Scottish Association
for the Medical Education of Women, the arrangements for teaching
and fees being the same as those of the School of Medicine, the
Teachers and Lecturers being duly qualified Lecturers of the School
of Medicine, and the classes recognised as the Extra-Mural School.
Since degrees can be taken in London, Victoria, and elsewhere, the
prime difficulties in the medical education of women are practically
overcome. Thirty-four women at present attend these classes.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>St. Andrews University was founded in 1411; and besides its
own colleges, it has affiliated to it, “University College,” Dundee.
This famous University has long been friendly to women. In 1876,
it added to the ordinary local Certificates a new and higher “Certificate
for women” in three subjects, of the same standard as the
M.A. Degrees; and later on an examination in seven subjects
secured a Diploma with the Title L.A., and the privilege of being
allowed to wear the University Badges. As residence at the University
was not necessary, and as there was no limiting clause as to
age, though the questions were hard, and the standard high, these
examinations became very popular. In 1892, there were 700
candidates at 36 centres, among which were Berlin, Birmingham,
Constantinople, Cork, Dresden, Dublin, Edinburgh, London, Marseilles,
Pietermaritzburg, Seville, Truro, Uitenhage, and Wolfenbüttel.
They have thus spread widely over the continent of Europe,
and invitations have been sent to form centres in America, which
are now under consideration. This Diploma is recognised as equivalent
to the “Brèvet Superieur” for admission to the Sorbonne
Examinations in Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the St. Andrews Professors had given lectures to women
in the neighbouring town of Dundee as well as in St. Andrews. So
the soil was prepared for the passing of the Scottish Universities Bill.
St. Andrews nobly went as far as it could, in fulfilling these, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>therefore in the University Calendar for the session appears, “The
University Court of the University of St. Andrews, in consultation
with the Senatus Academicus, has resolved to open <i>all</i> its classes in
Arts, Science, Theology and Medicine to women students. Women
may henceforward matriculate as Students of the University and be
admitted to any class or classes they may select, with a view to graduation
in Arts, Science, Theology or Medicine. In the year 1893 a
sum of <i>£</i>30,000 will become available for Bursaries or Scholarships
at the University, one half of which is reserved for women students
exclusively; those who intend to enter the Medical Profession
having a prior claim to these Bursaries, though they are tenable
while Arts and Science Classes are being attended. A Hall of
Residence for women students will be instituted, where they can live
together under a head.” Mrs. Morrison Duncan of Naughton’s
liberality has made it possible to offer ten Bursaries to women at
the very outset of their career. Nineteen women matriculated in
October. The LL.A. examinations will go on all the same for
those who cannot attend the University.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>Glasgow University was founded in 1450, by a Bull from Pope
Nicholas V. After the Reformation, in 1577, James VI. gave it a
new Charter. Glasgow University has some special claims to notice
in the way that it has followed the lines of the Scottish Universities
Acts of last year.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1876 a movement for the University Education of Women was
initiated, and the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of
Women founded. Shortly afterwards a liberal friend gave ground
and funds to build a College for women, to be called the Queen Margaret
College. There the University Professors and Assistants have lectured,
good work has been done and examinations instituted. But
when the ordinances of the Scottish Universities Acts came into force
in February, 1892, the existence of Queen Margaret College endowment
enabled the Glasgow Senatus to proceed on different lines from
the other Universities. The Executive Council of Queen Margaret’s
College arranged to hand over to the University the College Buildings,
grounds and endowment, on condition that they should be used
for University Classes for Women exclusively. Their College therefore
becomes University Property and Part of the University, and
the old Executive Council is about to dissolve. It is now governed
by the University Court and Senate, who make all the appointments
and arrangements for classes; the classes qualify for the University
Degrees, in the same way as the classes at Gilmore Hill, the Men’s
University Buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Students must matriculate as the men do; they have seats in the
College Chapel, use of the Libraries and Museums; the University
prizes are open to them, and graduates will be admitted to Convocation.
There is a full curriculum kept up in Arts and Medicine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and the girls who go up for preliminary Arts, Science and Medicine
Examinations and Degree Examinations are examined along with
the men, under the same conditions. There is a good attendance
at the classes, 86 having matriculated in Arts, and 45 in
Medicine, 131 in all compared with 1935 men students. The votes
of the undergraduate girls have been solicited already in the election
of the Lord Rector.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the apparatus in the Queen Margaret College is not sufficient
to illustrate the Science and Medical Classes, the supply is supplemented
from the other building, or the girls may go there for demonstrations,
at different hours from the men. There are several women
going up not only for Preliminary exams. in Arts, but for Professional
exams. in Medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The relation between the two Colleges has been sometimes called
Affiliation. This is incorrect. Affiliation supposes a separate
governing body and other details of separate existence. At one time
Affiliation was suggested, but the Rulers of Queen Margaret College
preferred that it should be taken over and become a part of the
University. The new arrangement works very well, and in a large
University like Glasgow the women prefer it to mixed classes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Medical Department of the College is the only active School
of Medicine for women belonging to a University in this Country.
As applications are constantly being received, the number of its
students is likely to increase rapidly. After Matriculation, women
are admitted to the Hunterian Museum, have permission for the usual
attendance in the Wards and on the clinical Lectures at the Royal
Infirmary. The classes in Medicine being University classes, certificates
of attendance thereon may be used by those who propose to
become Candidates for the degrees of the other Scottish Universities,
for those of the London University, Victoria University, and the
Royal University of Ireland, as well as for the Qualification of the
Scottish Corporations, the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of
Edinburgh and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow
(Conjoint).</p>

<p class='c008'>Glasgow University, like that of Edinburgh, for the time being,
has made those differences in favour of women that we call Retrospective
Recognition, of those who had attended classes in Queen
Margaret College, though there are none completely ready to take
full advantage of it. As soon as arrangements are fully made for
their education, the conditions for women will be the same as for
men.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>The University of Aberdeen was founded in 1494. Women’s
claims on its attention have not been so persistent as they have been
in the Southern Universities. But it rose to the new conditions of
the Scottish Universities Acts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ordinance No. 18 of the Universities Commission having passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the University Court of Aberdeen, on the recommendation of the
Senatus, resolved to admit women to <i>Graduation</i> in <i>all</i> Faculties.
As to their <i>instruction</i>, women are, within the University, on the
same footing as men, in the Faculties of Arts and Divinity, Science,
and in the Faculty of Law, except <i>so far</i> as the class of Medical
Jurisprudence is concerned, which is classified with the other
Medical classes proper, in which the University has meantime considered
it not advisable to provide the necessary instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eleven women have matriculated this year and have commenced
with the Class of Literature. In answer to a question the Secretary
of the Senatus replied, “When we have any women Graduates,
questions of their privileges will have to be considered. But I can
see no ground on which membership in our General Council can be
denied to them, except there be any legal difficulty connected with
the right of every member of Council to vote for the M.P. for
Glasgow and Aberdeen.”</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>Durham University was founded in 1832-33 by the Dean and
Chapter of Durham; the Newcastle-on-Tyne College of Medicine
was made an integral part of the University in 1870, the Newcastle
College of Physical Science in 1871. There is no notice of Women
in the Calendar. Women have from the beginning been admitted
to the classes of the College of Physical Science in Newcastle, but
not to the Medical College in Newcastle nor to the Durham College
itself. A strong petition was drawn up in 1881 to admit women to
<i>full</i> privileges in Durham, but Convocation refused to allow women
matriculation unless a Hostel were established, that is, they would
have no “unattached” women students. It is always difficult to
find funds for the needs of women, and the “Hostel” was not at
once forthcoming. Convocation assented to the following:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“1. That female students who shall have fulfilled the requirements
of the University regarding residence and standing shall be admitted
to the Public Examinations and have first degree in Arts of the
University.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the University discovered, or thought it did, that by their
Charter they could not admit women to full Degrees, and so the
matter dropped. In Newcastle, however, women have gone on attending
the classes. They can go in for the same Examinations as
men, and gain the Class Prizes, but they are excluded from degrees.
Titles such as A.S.C., “Associate of Science”; C.E., “Civil
Engineer”; L.S., “Licentiate in Surgery,” they may obtain. Among
the Students working for A.S.C., women are about 1 to 30. Among
the ordinary matriculated students, the average of the sexes are
about equal. Among non-matriculated students who attend such
classes as Literature, Fine Art, etc., the women are about 30 to 1.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>When we come to the older Universities, it seems but just to consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the women-benefactors as being related somehow to the
Colleges; and through them to the University itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oldest College at Cambridge, St. Peter’s, was founded in
1284. The second, Clare College, was founded in 1326 by the Lady
Elizabeth, sister and co-heir of Gilbert, Earl of Clare. Three
scholarships in this college were founded by Mrs. Tyldesley de
Bosset.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pembroke College or Valence-Mary, 1347, was founded by
Mary de St. Paul, widow of <i>Aymer</i> de Valence, Earl Pembroke.</p>

<p class='c008'>Corpus Christi, 1352, was founded by the Guilds of Corpus Christi
and the Blessed Virgin Mary. These old Guilds had “sustren” as
well as “brethren” in their fraternity, and consequently women had
something to do with that foundation, however little it may generally
be recognised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Queen’s College was founded 1448, by Queen Margaret of Anjou,
and refounded by Elizabeth Widville, Queen of Ed. IV.</p>

<p class='c008'>St. Catherine’s was founded 1473, by Dr. Robert Wodelarke, but
large benefactions from Mrs. Mary Ramsden endowed 14 scholarships.
Other benefactors were women.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christ’s College, 1505, was refounded by Lady Margaret, Countess
of Richmond and Derby (mother of Henry VII.), and 2 scholarships
were given by Lady Drury.</p>

<p class='c008'>St. John’s, 1511, was also founded by Lady Margaret (mother of
Henry VII.) and a fellowship was given by Lady Jane Rokeby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Magdalen holds benefactions from the Countess of Warwick, Lady
Anne Wray, Mrs. Margaret Dongworth, and others.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Trinity, 1546, Queen Mary added 20 scholarships. Mrs.
Mednyanszky is an important benefactor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sidney Sussex was founded 1594 by Lady Frances Sidney,
Dowager Duchess of Sussex.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are some of the gifts women have given to Cambridge. It
proves that the sex valued and honoured learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hitchin Temporary College was opened for women by the Cambridge
Association for the Education of Women, in Oct., 1869,
and a rapid success enabled the friends of women to incorporate
Girton College, 1872, to which the students removed in 1873, and
Newnham was founded in Oct., 1875.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first there was no connection with the University at all. Then
women were allowed to have examination papers, and to answer
the questions, but no information was given as to the Class of the
Student except privately. No official record was kept of these informal
examinations. But in 1882 by a grace of the Senate the
examinations were thrown open to women students of Girton and
Newnham who had passed certain preliminary exams, and had
resided the proper number of terms, had paid the customary fees,
and had been recommended by the authorities of their College.
Class Lists have ever since been published in which the exact place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of the women is mentioned with regard to the men. Some women,
such as Miss Ramsay and Miss Fawcett, would have held the first
place, had they been allowed to take it. No Prizes or Degrees are
granted them by the University. But what is called a Degree
Certificate is conferred upon any student whose proficiency has been
certified by the standard of examinations qualifying for B.A., which
entitles the holder to all the rights and privileges of certificated
students. These are signed by the Vice Chancellor. There is no
probability at present of their receiving degrees. The objection is
that this would make them eligible as members of senate. As there
is no matriculation, women cannot even become under-graduates in
Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Cambridge University Calendar now gives the conditions of
the admission of women to University Examinations.</p>

<hr class='c034' />

<p class='c008'>Oxford, oldest in foundation, is youngest in regard to granting
privileges to women.</p>

<p class='c008'>University College, Oxford, is said to have been founded in 872
by Alfred. In it a Civil Law Fellowship was founded by Mary
Anne, Viscountess Sidmouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Balliol College was founded by John Balliol and Devorgilla,
his wife, 1263-8. Eight scholarships were founded by Hannah
Brackenbury, in Law, History, and Natural Science.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Exeter College, founded 1314, 2 scholarships were given by
Miss Hasker.</p>

<p class='c008'>Queen’s College was founded 1340, by Hubert de Eglesfield,
Chaplain to Philippa, Queen of Edward III.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Brasenose, founded 1509, Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Somerset,
founded 22 scholarships, and Misses Colquilt, 3 exhibitions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christ Church holds 2 scholarships from Mrs. Dixon, and Miss
Slade’s exhibition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jesus College was founded in 1571, by Queen Elizabeth. Wadham
in 1612, by Nicholas Wadham of Merifield and Dorothy, his
wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Pembroke College, founded 1624, by King James I., his
Queen, Anne, attached a Canonry of Gloucester to the Mastership.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Worcester, founded 1714, Mrs. Sarah Eaton was a benefactor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be that the result of there being fewer female benefactors
in Oxford than in Cambridge may have affected the comparative
want of gratitude to women in this city. Whatever be the cause,
the oldest University is the hardest to move.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oxford Lectures for the benefit of women were started as early as
1865, but not in connection with the University. In 1873, another
scheme was set on foot by a Committee of Ladies. But the formation
of the “Association for the Education of Women,” such as at
present exists, was first suggested by Professor Rolleston, June,
1878.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>The first series of Lectures commenced in October, 1879. In
1880 one College Lecture was attended. At the present time
students are admitted under certain regulations to lectures in almost
every College in Oxford. The Lectures are of three kinds. Those
of the University generally are open without fee, those in the
different colleges for men, for which fees are paid, and those provided
by the Association, for which fees are paid. Until 1884, the
only Oxford Examinations open to Students of the Association were
those provided for women by the Delegates of Local Examinations.
In that year, in answer to a petition put forward by the Association
and numerously signed by resident M.A.’s, a Statute was passed by
Convocation opening to women, Honour Moderations, and the
Final Honour Schools of Mathematics, Science, and Modern History.
In 1888, another Statute admitted women to the Final School of
Literæ Humaniores, and in 1890, to the Honour Law School and
the Final Examination for Mus. Bac. All examinations for B.A.
in Honours are now opened to women, except Theology and Indian
languages, for which no application has been made.</p>

<p class='c008'>The University, like that of Cambridge, does not admit women to
Matriculation, or Graduation, but it does not impose on them all
the restrictions of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>The University Examinations for women still provide for all Pass
Subjects and for the Honour Subjects of English and Modern Languages,
in which there are no University Examinations for men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three Halls have been founded, Lady Margaret Hall, 1879
(Church of England with liberty for other denominations); Somerville
Hall, 1879 (non-denominational), and St. Hugh’s, 1886 (Church
of England). There are also unattached students residing in Oxford
under certain regulations. From 1879 to 1892 the number of
students has been in all 539. But though women are admitted to
the Oxford University Exams., Honours and Pass, and are ranked
in Classes, they have no reward or recognition by the University,
and no notice of women appears in the University Calendar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore in a country in which Free Trade principles have been
forced on the British farmer for the benefit of other classes of the
community, however prejudicial to his own, protection still reigns in
these old Universities, that illogically “protect” the stronger against
the weaker sex, who are thus forced to prove their capability
in face of many difficulties and overwhelming odds.</p>
